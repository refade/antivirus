SUMMARY:Iceland\, Year 3: The Undiscovered Country
DESCRIPTION: \nQuite simply\, we will be getting lost in Iceland. After our 2010 & 2011 workshops\, we can’t wait to return to share this breath taking location with more people. This is one of the last\, uncorrupted landscapes on the planet and we will be on an all terrain vehicle exploring areas that are impossible to get to by a standard vehicle. Be prepared to be blown away! From the wonderfully photogenic city of Reykjavik to the incredible\, vast\, and varied landscapes\, to the mind blowing glaciers\, awesome waterfalls\, geo-thermal springs and power plants\, rugged coastlines\, turf houses (my personal favorite)\, and much more\, this is a photo trip of a lifetime. Between shooting sessions\, we will get in some class time for critiques\, software training (Nik plugins\, Alienskin\, Topaz\, etc.) and discussion. \nNEW! We will be actively shooting with the iPhone and processing as we go\, using apps to create new and unique interpretations of this incredible landscape. \nFocus on Nature and owner\, Einar Erlendsson\, know the area intimately\, including where to go and when to go there. We found the organization top notch\, flexible\, creating a great atmosphere\, and doing absolutely everything possible to maximize the experience. \nThere is a bit of darkness at this time of year\, which will present opportunities for exciting low light photography and possibly some light painting!! \nWe look forward to sharing this great adventure! \n
