		<p>Get Madonna arms in 5 easy moves. Yes that is right. Get Rid Of Flabby Arms Fast. I know this video is targeted to my female readers&#8230; I know you are out there reading on tips I give to the men or just my own experience. With a little over a month left for spring&#8230; Oh I can hear the birds chirping, smell the flowers, and feel the warmth already! I have recently received a few request from women to share how I maintain my arms in such great shape. I don&#8217;t have a lot going for my self in terms of looks, but I do admit I got some of the hottest arms in the industry! Thanks to my early years of swimming and volleyball, even after playing competitively I kept up with the workout routine.<br />
<a href="http://adrianagomez.com/2011/02/get-rid-of-flabby-arms-in-5-easy-moves-even-for-the-skinny-b/getridofflabbyarms1/" rel="attachment wp-att-801"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-801" title="getridofflabbyarms1" src="http://adrianagomez.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/getridofflabbyarms1-232x300.jpg" alt="" width="232" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>And as superficial as it may sound, common we all know we <strong>ALL</strong> get judge on our looks first. So as the heat increases the layers of clothes decrease. Start with something small like working out on those arms! I have seen &#8220;skinny&#8221; girls with flabby, flabby like wave two times atCha arms&#8230; not cool. So mellow the Jell-O and the cottage cheese on those arms and ladies unless you watch this video and do the exercises I would think twice about wearing those tube tops and tank tops.</p>

		<p>Spring is here and my wedding is less than 4 months away!  This is post #1 in my special Spring Cleaning Week. In this post I will share with you my fool proof tips on weight loss without the expensive gym membership or hours spent on the breaking a sweat! People believe that cleaning can only happen on the exterior, but truth is it all starts from within. Now I am not trying to get “spiritual” with you I am simply sharing what to me is a fact. Yes a fact. What you think about, what you eat and what you believe in really do shape up to be what you look like, feel like, and what your life is like. In this first post I would like to share my tips on cleaning up and taking control of your body. I do not claim to be a fitness guru or health nut, I am however a very normal girl who loves food, who was raised on a rice and beans diet , who was NOT blessed with a fast metabolism who has lost and kept off about 45lbs without any &#8220;Diets&#8221;<br />
<a href="http://adrianagomez.com/2011/04/5-quick-and-easy-tips-to-loose-weigh/adrianabeforeandafter/" rel="attachment wp-att-954"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-954" title="AdrianaBEFOREandAFTER" src="http://adrianagomez.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/AdrianaBEFOREandAFTER-300x277.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="277" /></a><br />
This picture here shows my transformation from a chubby “Tortilla Girl” as I was once called to someone who still LOVES tortillas, but can strut her stuff in skinny jeans, run half marathons and not live on a lettuce diet. Ok so without any more complications I will answer the “How I Did It” question and share with you my full proof plan of how to cut the fat and keep it off.</p>
<p><strong>1. Understand You Body Type</strong><br />
See we are NOT all created equal. Some people have big bobbies, others big thighs, some have a booty and others have big arms. Haven’t you noticed your friends are all shaped differently? Check out the pictures below and find your body type.<br />
<a href="http://adrianagomez.com/2011/04/5-quick-and-easy-tips-to-loose-weigh/bodytypes/" rel="attachment wp-att-959"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-959" title="bodytypes" src="http://adrianagomez.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/bodytypes-300x211.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="211" /></a></p>
<p>Many of us who have what I call the “Pear Shape or Type 2” are so adamant on being a “Type 1” or those of us who have broad shoulders or are not petite keep comparing ourselves to little 4 foot nothing girls. Let me share this with you… you will not and cannot look like the other person. Once you identify your body type you can identify what has to and can go and what your born with and should just learn to love. For example, I am a Body Type 1. I struggle with love handles. I eat a pea and it goes straight to my love handles! But I have slim legs and a decent booty. So knowing my shape I can work on those areas.</p>
<p><strong>2. Understand Metabolism </strong><br />
Someone once told me “Your body’s metabolism is like a computer. When you do not feed it, it will go on sleep mode and on sleep mode it stops working and stops burning calories.” So because of this you want to get rid of the idea of eating 3 square meals a day. Breakfast, Lunch Dinner is old school. The way the fitness and nutrition experts recommend is 5 small meals day.<br />
<strong>Try this:<br />
Breakfast<br />
Morning Snack<br />
Lunch<br />
Afternoon Snack<br />
Dinner</strong><br />
Making sure each time you eat is roughly approximately 300 calories with 2 of those meals stretching to 500 calories.</p>
<p><strong>3. Count Your Calorie Budget</strong><br />
Point #2 is connected to point #3. Do yourself a favor and visit http://www.freedieting.com/tools/calorie_calculator.htm<br />
Input all the information and find out what your ideal calorie count is and think of that as your “Calorie Budget” for the day. I suggest you begin to pay attention to what you eat and especially what you drink. It is shocking to learn that some drinks have as many calories as a burger! Yes that fancy frappachino you are drinking is loaded with calories and fat.<br />
<strong><br />
4. Beware of the 3 Ds – Drinks, Dressings and Desserts</strong><br />
I know I love all three too! Now I know some of you loooooooooooove your Cokes in the morning and your colorful fruit juices and loads of dressings on your salads. But I promise you this single step of eliminating these three items from your daily diet can make a world of a difference. Pay attention to what you drink. Sometimes these drinks can pack more sugar and calories than a cheeseburger! And that salad that was healthy, once you poor your ranch dressing on it is equivalent to the fat and calories in chili cheese fries. So follow my tips.</p>
<p><strong>The only liquids I drink are:</strong><br />
1. Water<br />
2. Coffee or Team<br />
3. My favorite low sugar and calorie protein shake.<br />
4. Wine<br />
5. Non-Fruity mixed drinks…. Stick to Liquor and seltzer or tonic.</p>
<p><strong>Dressings and Sauces … </strong><br />
1. Always ask for sauce and dressing on the side<br />
2. When eating pasta choose a red tomato based sauce over milk and cheese based sauces.<br />
<strong>Dessert</strong><br />
1. Know what satisfies your sweet tooth and find a healthy alternative to it. For example I LOOVEEEEEEEEEE ice cream so a low fat soft serve yogurt or sorbet does the trick with half the calories.<br />
5. Sharing Is Caring and Also a Great Way To Maintain Your Weight.<br />
We live in a “Super Sized” world. Everything is Ginormous…. So my trick is sharing or splitting. If I am out eating at a restaurant I either share my dinner or once I get my dish I immediately ask for a to go box. Eat only half and save the other half for next days’ lunch or eat it later that evening.</p>
<p>Lastly I want to remind you that everything in moderation is key and that these are simply my tips that I follow til this day. I enjoy great food way too much to completely eliminate one type or another. So instead I just keep up with these 5 simple steps and keep trotting along from great restaurant to great restaurant. Life is too short… eat dessert first!</p>
<p>What are your “stay in shape tips” share with us please, we would like to know.</p>

		<p>Mornings, you either love them or hate’em. Here is Making The Most Of Your Morning. I have always been a part of the team which loves mornings. I remember even as a kid growing up in the southern California coast, I enjoyed the cold, crips, dewing morning walks to school. Of course like many of you I too hit the snooze button…. Several times and I want to stay in bed and snuggle, rather than get up. <a href="http://adrianagomez.com/2011/04/how-to-make-your-morning-less-hectic/hectic-mornings/" rel="attachment wp-att-1115"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1115" title="Hectic-Mornings" src="http://adrianagomez.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Hectic-Mornings-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a></p>
<p>And on cold mornings I don’t even want to think about leaving the warm blankets, but it is not about not wanting to sleep it is about how you start your day. Today, I realize more and more how important it is to not only learn to enjoy mornings, but really devise a plan to make sure your mornings are enjoyable and start off on the right track.</p>
<p>I do not claim to be a ball of sunshine every morning, but I will say I am 99% more likely to have a kick butt start to my day vs. the rest of the world, so cannot hurt to see what I do to make sure my days start in the best possible way. Making the most of your morning starts here. Here are a few things I do to make sure I start my day out right and you should try them too!</p>
<p><strong>Never Go To Sleep Upset or Unsettled</strong><br />
There is nothing worse you can do to your state of mind and wellbeing than to finish your day in a bad mood. I have done that before and it eats ya up! Maybe you had a fight with your significant other or got some bad news whatever it is the worse thing to do is “pretend” to “let it go” and “fall asleep”. I use quotations because we all know if you have done this before, your mind really does not shut down. You stay up restless in bed and cannot fall asleep.</p>
<p>So how do you get out of that mood? Try to solve the problem or talk about it to someone. Sometimes simply sharing what is bothering you with someone whom you respect and cares about you is extremely helpful since they can add a perspective you may not have seen and offer help or advice.</p>
<p><strong>Always Plan Out Your Day The Night Prior</strong><br />
I learned this habit and tip years ago and have adopted it in my nightly routine ever since. If you find yourself waking up and not really knowing what to do with your day, lollygaging around the house or you are so stuck in your “Go to work routine” you hop in your car or on the metro and ask yourself “How the heck did I make it into work today?” Then you are running on auto pilot and have no plans to accomplish anything new.</p>
<p>So do this, hake a list of things you want to do or accomplish the next day or even add things for the week.</p>
<p>There is no right or wrong way to make this list, just start writing and make it. I will share more about <strong><a href="http://casadewinn.com/how-to-make-a-to-do-list/">How To Make A To Do List</a> </strong>in future post, but for now write down anything even something like “Pluck my eyebrows” or “pay my cell phone bill” like I said anything and everything you need to get done.</p>
<p>Next, have somewhat of a plan of when to do some of the things listed. Not all will be able to be completed the following day, but maybe some you can knock out at your lunch break or in the evening. Do it and you will find you will be more restful when you sleep.</p>
<p><strong>Sleep In Something Comfortable or…. Nothing at All</strong>.<br />
Worst thing to do is go to sleep uncomfortable, so invest into some comfy jammies or if you prefer the Birthday Suit then by all means, sleep naked! Some people like to sleep with socks on others don’t. Some like sleeves others don’t. Wear what is comfortable to you.</p>
<p><strong>Invest Into A Great Pillow or Someone To Snuggle With</strong><br />
A few weeks ago I was given this stuffed animal bulldog as a gift. It isn’t very big or the most elaborate fluffy animal, but man oh man it is very comfortable! I booted my pillow and when I sleep alone lay my head on his butt and that becomes my pillow! So maybe you need a fancy pillow or your own plush animal or my favorite a nice chest and someone to snuggle with. Where and how you rest your head is important in having a great night sleep, so go on and get yourself something or someone to lay on!</p>
<p><strong>It Is Better To Sleep Alone Than In Bad Company</strong><br />
My mom taught me this at a very young age. She used to always say <em>“it is better to be alone than in bad company”</em> and this extends with who you share your bed with. If the person you fall asleep to nightly no longer is the one you want to snuggle up against and wrap your arms around them and instead you find yourself laying at the edge of your bed wondering how the heck you don’t fall off it, then there is more to consider. I have always said to myself, <strong>&#8220;the person I fall asleep with every night has to be someone who makes me want to jump their bones and want to wake up to see the next day with.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Wee Hours Of The Morning Sex (If Applicable)</strong><br />
Ok, ok so whether it is early morning sex or night sex or quickie sex or all night long sex… my point is pretty clear… make sure you are having sex…. protected safe sex that is. And please people do not take this the wrong way I have to set out my warnings this does not mean I feel you should go around sleeping with everyone giving them a turn. I am talking about the humanistic, health and mental benefits of a good, happy, loving sex life. If you are blessed to have a partner then great for you, the challenge here is how to keep the sex great and enjoyable. If you do not, then listen we are all human beings and our animalistic urges cannot and will not be stopped suddenly so without getting to much into details figure something out, there are plenty of helpful “tools” to help satisfy that area of our basic human needs.</p>
<p><strong>Pleasurable Morning Sights and Sounds</strong><br />
What you see and hear when you first wake up plays an important role in your morning so if you have one of these annoying or scary fire alarm sounding alarms… change it! Try something that is a little more pleasant, but yet loud enough to wake you up. Who do you talk to in the morning? Are they someone who makes you feel good or upsets you? Is your room bright? Do you have nice sights surrounding you? Maybe post up some pleasant pictures or landscapes.</p>

	<div class="post-entry">
		
		<p>Ever wonder what the difference between a cold press juicer and a centrifugal juicer is? Or maybe you didn&#8217;t even know there were different type of juicers out there, well there is! Not all juicers are created equal. If you are new to the world of juicing I hope to shed some light and let you know that in the world of juicers, the first thing that you need to know is that juicers fall into two main categories: centrifugal juicers and cold press or also known as masticating juicers. Juicing has become a fashionable and “In” thing to do and with great reason…it is great for you!</p>
<p>Whichever type of juicer you chose to buy the important thing is to use it and juice. Some juicing is better than no juicing, so what is the difference between a cold press juicer and centrifugal juicer?</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Centrifugal juicers</b></span> are more common, and in general, more affordable. They typically have an upright design in which food is pushed into a rapidly spinning mesh chamber with sharp teeth. The teeth shred the food into a pulp, and pulls the juice out of the pulp and through the mesh filter, where it is funneled out of the juicer.  Centrifugal juicers work best with soft and hard fruits and vegetables, but not quite as well with leafy greens like kale or spinach two vegetables I love to juice and are very healthy for you.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2943" src="http://adrianagomez.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ikon.jpeg" alt="ikon" width="225" height="225" /></p>
<p>Centrifugal juicers are a great starter juicer as they require very little investment with most good-quality models ranging in price from $100 to $199.</p>
<p>Popular centrifugal juicers include <strong>Jack LaLanne&#8217;s Power Juicer</strong> which was the first juicer I bought and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;"><a href="http://adrianagomez.com/jack-lalanne-juicer-review/"><span style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;">wrote a review on it here.</span></a>  </span>This one from <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;"><a href="http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/product.asp?SKU=14770267"><span style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;"><b>Breville</b></span></a>,</span>  is in my opinion the best centrifugal juicer on the market.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Cold Press/Masticating juicers</b></span> typically have a horizontal design in which a spiral tube called an auger that lays horizontally.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2937" src="http://adrianagomez.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/auger-300x130.jpeg" alt="cold press juicer" width="300" height="130" /></p>
<p>The pieces of fruits and vegetables are pushed into the top of the auger, and they are crushed and squeezed by the spiral tube.</p>
<p>Juice drains out of the underside of the tube, while the pulp is squeezed out at the end of the tube.  I like to give my dogs the left over pulp as a treat, they love it!</p>
<p><a href="http://adrianagomez.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/omegajuicer.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2938" src="http://adrianagomez.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/omegajuicer.jpeg" alt="omegajuicer" width="275" height="183" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of the slower crushing and squeezing action, cold press juicers can process leafy greens like spinach and kale. The most important thing in my opinion is that the juice that they produce will last much longer than juice made in a centrifugal juicer, which should be consumed right away as it starts losing nutrients nearly immediately. When I made my fist juice using a cold press juicer I immediately noticed the difference. These juicers produce the type of juice quality in those cold pressed juices selling for like $8 a serving with minimal foam and separation. The difference is very noticeable. Since the juice you can make using a cold press machine is &#8216;Living Juice&#8217;, retaining its nutritional integrity 48-72 hours after extraction, I usually make a juice to use for the next 2 mornings. Cold pressed juicers are tested and proven to extract the highest yield of nutrients and enzymes than any centrifugal juicer in the market.</p>
<p><a href="http://adrianagomez.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Cold-Press-vs-Centrifugal-Juicers-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2944" src="http://adrianagomez.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Cold-Press-vs-Centrifugal-Juicers-1-300x230.jpg" alt="Cold-Press-vs-Centrifugal-Juicers-1" width="300" height="230" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The quality remains the same and you will notice there is no juice separation. Cold press juicers are pricier than centrifugal models; starting at around $230 for most models. Some of the brands to look for are Champion, Omega, and Green Star. I personally have tried 3 different juicers; the Jack Lalanne, a Breville and now I own this one: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www1.macys.com/shop/product/omega-8006-juicer-nutrition-center?ID=527562&amp;cm_mmc=Google_DMA_Home_Electrics_PLA-_-PLA+Home+Generic+-+Kitchen_PLA+-+Kitchen-_-37669322516_-_-_mkwid_efn00FyG|d{device}_37669322516%7C-%7Cefn00FyG"><span style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;">An Omega 8006.</span></a> </span></span>( thanks future hubby for the birthday gift! 😉 )</p>
<p><strong>So Which Is Better?</strong></p>
<p>With both juicing machines you are going to be able to extract juice from fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p>When purchasing a juicer it is important to pick one which caters to your lifestyle and needs.</p>
<p>Cold press juicers do have some design elements which require you to be more thorough when preparing to juice. Cold press juicers have a smaller feeding chute than a centrifugal juicer which means you need to be more patient when making the juice as it will take longer. So if you are on the run every morning this may not be the best for you and you may be better off with a centrifugal.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>As an estimate in time, if all fruits and vegetables were prepared and ready for juicing:</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Cold Press Juicer</strong> &#8211; Approximately 9-10 minutes</p>
<p><strong>Centrifugal</strong> &#8211;  5 minutes</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Clean Up Time</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Cold Press Juicer</strong> – 2 minutes</p>
<p><strong>Centrifugal</strong> &#8211; 7 minutes</p>
<p>Juicing is for the serious. The ones who want to make a difference in their health. Opt for buying fruits and vegetables that are organic unless you will be removing the peel. It really takes discipline to continue to juice and make it a habit. I promise you if you do you will notice a difference in your energy levels, skin clarity and your digestion. I gave up coffee nearly 2 years ago and now only drink it on occassion. My skin used to have many breakouts, but I can say it is pretty clear now. My digestion has improved and  do not have an poo problems! 🙂 And my dogs even enjoy the juice!  Just Juice It!</p>

		<p>What is the best detox? Is there such thing as the &#8220;best&#8221; detox? You may have recently decided you may needed to detox possibly after reading my <a href=" http://casadewinn.com/should-i-detox/">Should I Detox</a> article Or maybe you have been eating too much crap? Way to many things that come in fancy wrappers, color bubbly stuff and things you cannot pronounce? Alright you sick, mean, unappreciative B*&amp;^$#@(d I will help ya out. A detox can be very beneficial. In this post I talk about a few detox that work and that I have personally used. <a href="http://adrianagomez.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/What-is-the-best-detox-i.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2792" src="http://adrianagomez.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/What-is-the-best-detox-i.jpg" alt="What is the best detox " width="307" height="391" /></a></p>
<p>Although there are many types of detox diets, most eliminate foods that contain potentially harmful substances and allow foods that support the body’s natural ability to rid itself of toxins, such as dark, leafy green vegetables. In a detox solid food intake is reduced, ranging from small meals made up of mainly soup puree and vegetables to full-fledge juice fast. I may not know what is the best detox, but your body will!</p>
<p><strong>Here are a few of the most popular detox diets that I have tried and our popular amongst fellow detoxers.</strong><br />
• <strong>The Master Cleanse</strong> &#8211; Also called the lemonade diet, a fast that involves drinking only lemonade, grade B maple syrup, and cayenne pepper.</p>
<p>To me this is the most challenging one and also not very convenient if you have to continue with day to day activity. Lugging around your “juice” that looks like pee may not be too fun.</p>
<p>• <strong>Juice fasting </strong>– A type of fast that calls for consuming only fresh vegetable and fruit juices, such as beet juice and wheatgrass juice, and water.</p>
<p>• <strong>Smoothie and Shake fasting</strong> &#8211; Involves drinking pureed or blended vegetable and fruit smoothies, especially green smoothies.<br />
• <strong>Commercial cleanse programs</strong> – Specially designed protein powders, vitamins, nutrients for detoxification. You buy these at local health markets of vitamin shops.</p>
<p>• <strong>Raw Food Detox Diet</strong> &#8211; Based on the raw food diet. Involves only eating food that is raw or hasn’t been heated above 118 degrees.</p>

<p><strong>My “Detox” Plan</strong></p>
<p>I am doing a HYBRID of the Master Cleanse+ Raw Vegetables+ Puree soups. To me this is my favorite detox diet that works. I find that the morning routine suggested in master cleanse helps get my digestion a kickstart and the drinking of lemon water but I add raw veggies and pure nothing added organic vegetable <a href="http://adrianagomez.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/What-is-the-best-detox.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2787" src="http://adrianagomez.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/What-is-the-best-detox.jpg" alt="What is the best detox" width="136" height="225" /></a><br />
<a href="http://adrianagomez.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/What-is-the-best-detox-1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2788" src="http://adrianagomez.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/What-is-the-best-detox-1.jpg" alt="What is the best detox " width="300" height="223" /></a></p>
<p>I avoid meats, anything processed and no sugars… that includes fruits….they have tons of hidden sugars. Anything processed is basically anything that comes in a box, is microwaveable, comes in a colorful wrapper and does not rot or turn bad in less than 7 days. In addition, I also recommend you take probiotics during any of these detox cleanses. There are many probiotics to chose from. Head to your local shop and ask the sales rep there for one they recommend.</p>
<p>One week of cleansing your body from Cheetos, soda, bacon, burger,cookies, fried chicken, etc will not change things for you. To see ultimate benefits you must adopt this healthier way of eating as a lifestyle. Today there are many options for organic and healthy food. Many times the cost difference isn’t much.So think twice next time you are out grocery shopping when selecting between two choices of products. Opt for the healthier one even if it is a few cents more. My secret to staying YOUNG and HEALTHY is maintaining a eating plan of natural things. If it was once living on earth and grown here organically then you can be sure it is good for you to eat. Food is fuel to the body. Whatever you fuel it with will showcase in you!. So keeping it simple and whether there is such thing as the best detox diet maintain a diet of “Lots of fruits, veggies, fish, and whole grains” and you will be well on your way to staying young and healthy!</p>

		<p>Should I detox? Is a question many of us ask. I have asked that same question myself &#8220;Should I detox?&#8221; and although I do not claim to be a medical or health expert to claim it is good or not good for you. I will simply tell you I do it and I have been detoxing for the past 6 years. I like to do it at least two times a year. If I could I would do it quarterly. Some people are pretty hardcore and detox every other week! That is too much for me and I can&#8217;t handle that. But 2-4 times a year is something I can handle and like to do. So I am currently undergoing my annual cleansing. Many of you asked what I was doing. So here is not only what I am doing, because more important than that is the <strong>WHY</strong> and <strong>WHAT</strong> works for <strong>YOU</strong>.</p>
<p>Undergoing a Detox or a cleansing is not something for the weak minded or if you are considering it but if you are someone who is easily exhausted and have low blood pressure or may have a syndrome not recognized yet by a doctor, then I highly urge you to contact your doctor first before beginning any type of detox.</p>
<p>Secondly, you have to know WHY you would want to do a detox to know why detoxing is good for you.<br />
<strong>Are you looking for a quick way to loose weight?<br />
Do you feel yucky? Feel bloated and have been constipated?<br />
Are you curious what all the hoopla is?</strong></p>
<p>Well I do not claim to be an expert. I like many of you hit the internet to learn about this and also through my own experimentation and knowledge I have picked up by actual medical professionals that through the years have taught me more about this subject.</p>
<p>Why I am doing a cleanse?<br />
Because I understand the importance of regular bowl movements. (a.k.a pooping, dropping kids off at the pond, taking the browns to the superbowl, etc) and mentally training your body to eat when you need the food, to break my &#8220;habits&#8221; of needing certain foods, and just because I figure if it doesn&#8217;t kill me and many people say it is healthy to do, then do Just Do It.</p>
<p>I often hear people, especially girls, be “proud” to announce “Oh, I do not poop very much, only once a day…” as if it makes them more girly or pretty to say you do not poop. Well I have news for ya sister, it is actually terrible! And a big sign that you are messed up!</p>
<p>As I learned through some naturalistic medical experts a healthy person should be pooping at least 2-3 times a day. Getting rid of stools and urine is your body&#8217;s main method of getting rid of toxic substances. Regular bowel movements are needed to prevent toxins that are released from the bloodstream into the intestines from being reabsorbed into the body. Getting fiber from food is important. Just think, if there is a subway at 72nd and another one tries to come in…. there is major backup. One has to go so it makes space for the other. Your digestion is kind of like that.</p>
<p><strong>And I also learned about the different types of dookies….. such as…<br />
1. The Shooting Bullets<br />
2. The Submarine<br />
3. The Little Snakes<br />
4. The Messy All Over<br />
5. The One That Makes You Hurt, Scratch and Tear</strong><br />
<a href="http://adrianagomez.com/2011/05/detoxing-why-you-need-it/olympus-digital-camera/" rel="attachment wp-att-1340"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1340" title="Poop and why you need to detox" src="http://adrianagomez.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/poop_Detox-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a></p>
<p>None of those are good. <em><strong>“your poop should come out smooth like a soft serve smoothie”.</strong></em> Which is why detoxing is good for you.</p>
<p>Why does are digestion start messing up? All the processed crap we eat! America is infamous for food that is “man-made” and filled with all kinds of hormones &amp; pesticides all which end up finding a home in your little body.<a href="http://adrianagomez.com/2011/05/detox-diets-that-work/detox/" rel="attachment wp-att-1321"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1321" title="detox" src="http://adrianagomez.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/detox-300x270.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="270" /></a></p>

		<p>If you are a dog owner learning how to make dog food will be one of the most rewarding things you will ever give your beloved dogs. I will share with you one of my favorite organic dog food recipes homemade here, but first let me tell you how it all began. A few years ago my boyfriend and I bought our first dog together a cute Boston Terrier. We fell in love with him so much that we ended up getting our second Boston Terrier a few weeks later. <a href="http://adrianagomez.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Tuxedo-Buzz.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2460" title="Organic Dog Food Recipe" src="http://adrianagomez.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Tuxedo-Buzz.jpg" alt="Organic Dog Food Recipe" width="560" height="800" /></a></p>
<p>Our lives have never been the same and I mean that in a positive way. So when our puppies started having digestive issues and refused to eat their store bought food, like any parent we rushed them to veterinarian office and had them checked up. The only thing our vet could recommend is buying this expensive “vet recommended” dry kibble that was like $80 a bag and lasted only 3 weeks. This new “special” food only worked for a few days. We soon noticed our dogs having the same issues of diarrhea and not wanting to eat their food. My boyfriend and I were pretty stuck and worried. We were not sure what to do and what could help them. I have always been an advocate of healthy eating and have spent more than 10 years without touching any fast food and inspecting the ingredient list on virtually everything I eat…so why not treat my dogs the same way? My boyfriend and I started to look into what dog food was made of and comprised of and we were both pretty disgusted! 2 of the 100 ingredients were actually things I would want to feed my puppies so my boyfriend got the idea of making our own dog food so we did and since then all is history! Our puppies <strong>LOVE</strong> eating their organic dog food, we save money and they are very healthy, active and may I add very cute! So to all my dog owner friends out there I am sharing with you my very own organic dog food recipe you can easily make at home. Your dog will love you for it!</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong><br />
<strong>2-3 Whole Organic Chickens</strong></p>
<p>1 Bag or 10 Loose Organic Carrots</p>
<p>5 Medium Size Sweet Potatoes</p>
<p>1 Bag of Frozen Organic Peas or green beans</p>
<p>3 Cups of Organic Brown Rice</p>
<p>Necessary equipment: A real good chopper! I love the Ninja. You can pick one up at Wal-Mart for $20</p>
<p><strong>Step One</strong><br />
In a large pot fill with water and add your whole chickens. Bring water to boil and cover with a lid. Let it cook for 2 to 3 hours until chicken is very tender and disenagrates to the touch.<br />
<a href="http://adrianagomez.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_20130610_213232.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2450" src="http://adrianagomez.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_20130610_213232.jpg" alt="IMG_20130610_213232" width="1280" height="960" /></a><br />
<a href="http://adrianagomez.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_20130610_213357.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2451" src="http://adrianagomez.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_20130610_213357.jpg" alt="IMG_20130610_213357" width="1280" height="960" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Step Two</strong></p>
<p>Take your chickens out and place in a colander. While in the colander using two forks or any type of utensil continue to shredded the chicken and remove all bones. ( I recommend you wait an hour to let the chicken cool before doing this step)</p>
<p><a href="http://adrianagomez.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_20130611_190938.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2455" title="Organic Dog Food Recipes Homemade" src="http://adrianagomez.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_20130611_190938.jpg" alt="Organic Dog Food Recipes Homemade" width="1280" height="960" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Step Three<br />
</strong></p>
<p>While your chicken is being cooked or cooled wash your veggies and chop up your carrots and sweet potatoes. Cook your brown rice and begin to boil your peas and or green beans.</p>
<p><a href="http://adrianagomez.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_20130611_190846.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2453" src="http://adrianagomez.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_20130611_190846.jpg" alt="IMG_20130611_190846" width="1280" height="960" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://adrianagomez.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_20130611_190930.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2454" src="http://adrianagomez.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_20130611_190930-e1371682870640.jpg" alt="IMG_20130611_190930" width="960" height="1280" /></a></p>
<div id="attachment_2466" style="width: 1290px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://adrianagomez.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/peas.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2466" class="size-full wp-image-2466" title="Organic Dog Food Recipes Homemade" src="http://adrianagomez.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/peas.jpg" alt="Organic Dog Food Recipes Homemade" width="1280" height="960" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2466" class="wp-caption-text">Organic Dog Food Recipes Homemade</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step Four</strong></p>
<p>Mixing! Grab two large containers of your choice and begin proportioning your ingredients. I like to make each batch with a 60/30/10 ratio. I like to put 60% chicken, 30% vegetables and 10% brown rice. The brown rice acts as a filler so make sure not to add too much of it.</p>
<p><a href="http://adrianagomez.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Food.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2458" src="http://adrianagomez.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Food.jpg" alt="Food" width="1280" height="960" /></a></p>
<p><strong>They are both ready to eat! That is the before&#8230;.<br />
This is the after&#8230;.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://adrianagomez.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_3635.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2456" src="http://adrianagomez.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_3635.jpg" alt="IMG_3635" width="2592" height="1936" /></a></p>
<p>Clean plate! Nothing at all left &amp; healthy puppies!</p>
<p>I keep one batch to feed both my puppies and the other batch I freeze and then bring it out when I need it.</p>

		<p>I remember the first time I stepped inside a Chipotle I nearly walked in with my head down dragging my feet in shame. How can a California girl who grew up on home made Mexican food, who is surrounded by numerous taco shops &amp; delicious Mexican food come to such an establishment&#8230;and actually enjoy it!?? Well I had to eventually love it since I moved from San Diego and called the NYC my home. No authentic Mexican around here, so I settled for Chipotle. It isn&#8217;t as bad as you may think in fact I really do truly enjoy it. I like it so much that I have created a Chipotle burrito bowl night at my home for dinner. In this post I will share with you my Just Like Chipotle&#8217;s Burrito Bowl Recipe&#8230;(minus the bacon in the beans and minus the extra 500 calories your butt will thank you for)</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients<br />
Brown or White Rice (Brown is healthier) <a href="http://adrianagomez.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_20130516_185506.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2433" src="http://adrianagomez.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_20130516_185506.jpg" alt="IMG_20130516_185506" width="1280" height="960" /></a><br />
Black Beans<br />
Chicken Breast<br />
Tomatoes<br />
Corn<br />
Yellow Onions<br />
Purple Onions<br />
Cilantro<br />
Lime<br />
Salt<br />
Pepper</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step One</strong></p>
<p>Clean black beans and let them soak in water for 30minutes.<br />
For every cup of black beans you make, add 2 cups of water fill pot with water<br />
Add 1 tablespoon of salt (not a mountain full just a little)<br />
Bring to boil and then cover with lid and turn heat to low. let it cook for 2 hours.<br />
** I usually make these ahead of time or on a day you have errands to do at home just let them cook.</p>
<p><strong>Step Two</strong><br />
Make yourself some rice or use leftover rice.</p>
<p><strong>Step Three</strong><br />
Make the Pico de Gallo<br />

<p><strong>Step Four</strong><br />
<a href="http://adrianagomez.com/just-like-chipotles-corn-salsa-recipe-2/"><strong>Make the famous Corn Salsa from Chipotle. Click Here for a step by step guide.</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Step Five</strong><br />
Dice your chicken breast and add a little salt and pepper and place in a non stick pan to grill. Check chicken and make sure it is cooked thoroughly.</p>
<p><strong>Step Six</strong><br />
<strong>The fun begins! Start with add rice ( I serve myself very little since I kinda like my fit body right now&#8230;no need for extra carbs for me ) and add black beans on top. These beans are very healthy and are packed with fiber &amp; iron.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Add your grilled chicken.</strong><br />
