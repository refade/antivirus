<p>We had a simply beautiful day to celebrate the Memorial day weekend. The sun rose through clear skies over the ocean as we drove east to the Spring Tide. Heading out of the inlet the seas were less than the forecasted 1-3ft. By the time we reached the dive site they were almost flat. The boat’s mate, Bart, quickly hooked the wreck, and tied us in.</p>
<p>Vis on the wreck was 30- 40 feet (depending on who you ask). The storms earlier this week mixed the water enough to bring up the bottom temp close to 50 degrees. The crew did a great job and grappled right into the Wheelhouse, the tallest part of the ship. As we reached a depth of 40ft, the top of the wreck started to come into view, and the clear water made wreck lines unnecessary. There was a slight current from the east, but nothing unmanageable.</p>
<p>Schools of cunners, pollock and large tautog encircle the top and side of the superstructure. The top was covered with mussels, and swarms of small fish. Swimming down to the deck at 110 ft, the fish life dropped sharply. Large mussels could be found here with large starfish to match. The hatches are no longer on the holds, which now opened as gaping holes in the deck. My feeble light could not penetrate their dark depths. After swimming along the deck for several hundred feet, it became obvious that the interesting part of the wreck was behind us.</p>
<p>Returning to the upper levels of the superstructure, the other divers started appearing on the line. I persuaded a few fish into joining us back on the boat, and headed back to the line. While the water had been mixed up a bit, it was still warmer on the hang.</p>

<p>Back on the boat we did our surface interval watching Bart pick through the mussels he brought up, and taking pictures of the 24 inch tog. A few naps were had, and sea stories swapped.</p>
<p>The second dive was a bit cooler on the bottom. On the top of the wreck you could see the scintillation of the warm and cold water. Below this line the temp had dropped to 44 degrees. The current was about the same as before.</p>
<p>We started our search for lonely fish in search of a friend, circling the decks, peering in the large windows of the bridge passing under the walkways surrounding the decks. Deep in the wreck large tog could be seen staring back at us. They waited patiently for us to leave.</p>
<p>There was very little monofilament on this wreck. There were a couple of shot lines on the deck, but not much debris. This would be a great wreck for penetration. The openings were large and clear. The spaces inside looked to be easy to navigate. With proper gear, training and dive buddy, this could be a very interesting wreck.</p>
<p>As we returned to the surface the seas had subsided to only a few inches. There was hardly a breath of a breeze over the deck. Bart pulled the hook, and we headed back to shore, another great dive.</p>

<h3>Stolt Dagali, May 4, 05</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.sjue.com/images/independanceII.jpg" height="151" width="200" />This was the first dive trip of a brand new boat, the Independence II. We met Captains Dan Bartone, and Jay Tempe at the Winter Yacht Basin, Mantoloking, NJ. Having never been there before, we showed up early and watched the sun rise over the bay. The boat slipped in the yacht basin with the quiet hum of restrained power. The 42 foot Evans dive boat was equipped for 100 mile over night trips. She has a top speed of 29kt, and smelled of fresh paint and fiberglass.</p>
<p>We loaded our gear and strapped it down. The Dan offered us coffee they were brewing onboard, and someone brought doughnuts. The trip from Mantoloking to the inlet was slow through the back bay, but this gave us time to configure our gear for the dive. We passed the Seeker sitting by the dock just before heading out of the Manasquan inlet.</p>
<p>Once clear of the inlet, we cruised out to the Stolt at 20kt. The seas were flat (less than 1 ft), so it felt like we were standing still. The trip only took 30-40 minutes.</p>
<p>Jay hooked in and Dan and Mark Clark, jumped in to tie into the wreck. Dave and I helped Corey and Lewis gear up so they could jumped in next. Then we had the deck to our selves as we prepared for the dive.</p>
<p>The Stolt Dagali sits in 130 fsw. She was cut in half in an accident, and the stern sank to the bottom. She is laying on here side exposing the upper superstructure, the port hull, and the forward area where she was cut.</p>

<p>We had about 40 ft of vis on the wreck. Not bad given the rough seas for the past week. Dan and Mark swam the hook to the top of the port side at 50ft. This made navigation easy, just go to the top of the wreck when your done. Our plan was to do a quick sweep of the sand and see what was there, then sweep back and forth over the superstructure. Dave had not been on this wreck before, so I figured I’d give the guided tour.</p>
<p>Once on the sand, we did a quick sweep, and only saw an eelpout and two scallops. We came up to about 100&#8242; and did a sweep of the wreck. There are several large openings where you can see deep into the wreck. If you have the right training, it’s a good wreck for penetration. I was not equipped for this today, and would not consider attempting entry with an unfamiliar dive buddy. We just poked our heads in, and shined the dive lights around. Swimming along we ran into 5 or 6 large entry points. On the outside, I was encourage by the fresh covering of small muscles on the wreck, and the anemones were out and flowing in the soft current.</p>
<p>When we hit the aft section, with only the ship&#8217;s bottom before us, we turned around and headed forward. At the front, you can see the damage from the collision. You can count the decks as you pass them headed for the keel. Again once at the hull, we turned around and head aft. Each pass we would rise 10 feet or so. On the final pass we were at the anchor line at 50&#8242;. After effectively doing a slow ascent the whole dive, we started our short deco stops. Corey and Lewis were just above us on the last few stops.</p>
<p>Dave was diving a new drysuit. While he was dry and warm most of the dive, he found that his fins were loose. Given that the current was light, this was not an issue until he got on the ladder. At this time one of his fins fell off and headed quickly for the bottom. When we got on the boat, he dropped a weight overboard tied onto the end of his reel. The hope was that in the light current, the weight would be closed to the fin.</p>
<p>Lewis had apparently had a suit flood, and drained two gallons of water out of his dry suit. With the 41 degree bottom temp, and the 48 surface temp, he was quite cold by the end of the dive.</p>
<p>We sat and talked and sunned ourselves during the surface interval. Lewis was trying to warm up in his dry cloths as his suit was turned inside out hanging from the overhead. Jay had brought is Meg on the trip, and did not want to make a dive due the maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>On the second dive, we had a different dive plan. I grabbed my spare reel, and gave Dave my primary. I was going to hold the end of the line while descending the anchor line, tying off at the bottom. Dave borrowed a pair of fins, and would drop down on the line from his reel and look for his lost fin. Once he found it, or gave up trying, he would reel in to get back to the wreck. Meanwhile, I would use my backup reel so he could find me.</p>
<p>The plan went off without a hitch. Once I tied off my backup reel, I headed into the sand looking for scallops while I waited for Dave. Dave caught up with me about mid dive. By this time I had made my dent in the scallop population, and was headed back to the wreck. We did a few more passes around the wreck and headed back to the surface. Having spent most of the dive on the bottom, the deco was a bit longer. Dave’s was not as bad, so he headed for the surface. Mine was extended by the choice of gas. My O2 bottle was in for VIP, so deco on 50% took longer. Lewis and Corey were hanging 20ft below. I entertained myself observing their bubbles. I never noticed how the large bubbles reflect an image of what is above them. It’s a perfect mirror. After about 55 minutes in 45 degree water, I was getting a little cold and fortunately time was up.</p>
<p>I needed a little help getting on the deck with the catch bag. Lewis had nabbed a few scallops himself, but was shocked to see our haul. We quickly changed into dry cloths and headed back to shore. On the way in the inlet, we saw that the Seeker had been hauled out of the water and was sitting in the dry dock. We unloaded our gear at the dock and headed home. I could not wait to start up the grill.</p>

<p>When some diver friends invited me to join them on a liveaboard trip to Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI),  I was not sure how it would work out.   While my wife can&#8217;t dive, she does enjoy a trip to the tropics.  A liveaboard would be a bit much for her though.  When some of her friends invited her for a vacation to Costa Rica in the same time frame, I was set.<br />
TCI is at the end of the Bahamas chain, north of the Dominican Republic. Arriving at the airport in Providenciales, Provo for short, was reminiscent of most Caribbean islands.  The airport was small, and open.  We were through customs quickly, and we were soon on a shuttle headed for the boat.  We loaded our gear, and had a beer while we waited for the rest of the guests.</p>
<p>Once they all arrived, the crew started giving briefs on the boat procedures.  First we were instructed to remove our shoes and put them in a basket by the door.  We would not need them for the remainder of the week.</p>
<p>We configured our BCDs and regs on the tanks set up for us.  Storage for other dive items was under the bench in tupperware like containers. That was it.  You never had to remove your gear from that tank all week. Hangars were above the tanks for drying your wetsuit. There were two hot showers on the dive platform for washing off after the dive.   There was a large table for cameras and tank for soaking gear.  There was a additional cost for NITROX which worked out to $6 a tank.  More than worth it in my book.</p>

<p>After the crew gave us a tour of the ship, they showed us to our rooms.  Each room had a full head and shower. There was a television above a small desk. a closet for hanging items and drawer under the beds.   Our room was all the way forward, and looked out over the bow.  At dinner that night, the captain introduced the entire crew (5), and went over the schedule and procedures and boat rules.</p>
<p>Early the next morning, we got underway heading west for the uninhabited islands of West Caicos.  Since the prevailing winds were from the east, this provided shelter from the waves.  By noon we were in the water.  After diving up here all summer in a drysuit and doubles, it is refreshing to jump in with so little gear.   Each day the boat would move in the morning then we would do two dives.  After lunch we would move again and do two more dives.  After dinner we would do a night dive.   The last day we snuck in a pre-dawn dive, then a morning dive before pulling back into port.</p>
<p>The diving was very relaxed.  There was little to no current.  The boat was moored in the shallows about 30 yards from the wall.  TCI is the top of a atoll rising from one of the deepest parts of the ocean.   When I say wall, I mean WALL.  Since we did two dives at each site, we would go right on one and left on the other.   By the time we got back from the first dive, there would be schools of fish under the boat.    This often made for interesting safety stops.</p>
<p>To sum it all up, it was a fantastic trip!  Dive. Dive. Dive.  We did have a good group of divers.  The captain and crew were fantastic.   The cook made some great dishes.  Our only complaint, was that he should have served more fish.</p>

				<small>Wednesday, September 8th, 2004</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p><img src="http://www.sjue.com/images/np_stride.jpg" align="left"/>The morning started off with one of the most beautiful sunrises I have seen in a while. The flags were hanging motionless on their masts as I passed the USCG station at Indian River Inlet. All were good signs that it was going to be a great day. There were thin clouds to the east, reflecting the red and purple rays of the sun.</p>
<p>I had to do some searching to find the Surface Interval in the Marina. I had printed the wrong portion of the driving directions, and did not know which dock to find her on. But once the purple and red of the sunrise lit up the sky, I was able to navigate the docks and find the proper slip.</p>
<p>The Surface Interval is a 47ft Aluminum boat outfitted well for diving. The back is covered with a canopy sheltering divers and gear from sun and rain alike. The midsection has an upper and lower deck. Below are several rows of benches which can double as racks for the shorter members of the group. (I’m not so lucky.) The upper section is has benches on each side with more storage underneath, and an open middle. The front section of the boat is the pilot house, with a rack right behind the skipper.</p>
<p>Since she makes 20+ knots, the 30 mile trip to the Northern Pacific was shorter than expected. Several of us sat above and discussed the wreck with the local SCUBA veterans. We watched as the dolphins danced in our wake, escorting us out through the inlet. Others made use of the rack like benches below. I spent my time listening to the various descriptions of the site, what could be found, and what should be expected.</p>
<p>The wreck is upside down starting at 110ft and resting on the bottom at 140ft-150ft. There were many small holes in the hull, and one large open tear was some 30ft tall about amidships. To the one side there was a debris field which had once been the superstructure of the ship. Anchoring was usually into this debris, as anchoring an upside down hull was very difficult. The ship could be easily penetrated through the main tear.</p>
<p>The group that day was comprised of divers from New York, South Jersey, Delaware, and Virginia. One group of DIR divers was scheduling a video shoot of an extended penetration dive. Others were there in search of artifacts. Some, like me, were just there to see the wreck.</p>
<p>With my nickname of The Great White Hunter, I was disheartened to find that seabass and tog were both out of season in Delaware. The wreck was not known for lobster, was too deep for trigger, and scallops were unheard of. This left me with a sight seeing tour of the wreck. With hopes that there would be enough light for video, I had charged up the camera batteries. I started to the final assembly of the housing.</p>
<p>Once on the site, the captain hooked the wreck quickly, and the mate hopped in the set the hook. The divers started to gear up as we waited for the final word that the hook was set. Once the deck had cleared enough to gain access to my tanks, I started to gear up.</p>
<p>Trish, one of the boat’s crew and webmaster, was taking pictures of the divers as the prepared for the giant stride into the deep. Fighting the digital camera lag, she was trying to get someone in mid stride hanging over the water. I told her I had not done a giant stride entry in a while, since we usually roll in on most of the boats in NJ. I tried my hand at it, and she caught me stepping off.</p>
<p>Once in the water, Capt. Darryl handed down the camera, and I started down. The surface visibility was incredible. The mate and some of the other divers were already headed back. They could be seen down to 80ft in the bright, clear water. There was next to no current, as I swam down the granny line. Unfortunately, I did not get any video footage of the other divers under such great conditions.</p>
<p>The thermocline was at 80ft and the water got much darker. The temp dropped from 72 to 50 passing through 90ft, 100ft to 110ft. Suddenly the wreck became visible below. The anchor line continued down, but I was already over the hull. The anchor was in the debris field to the side of the wreck. The hull was right below, half covered in anemones. I quickly descended to the debris field at 130’ and took a few seconds to evaluate the conditions, and adjust my buoyancy and gear. Quickly adjusted to the light, I could easily make out the shape of the wreck. The visibility was easily over 40ft, and there was no current or surge discernable.</p>
<p>With the massive hull as a guide I decided against a reel, which would have made video very difficult. I headed a few yards out from the anchor and found the beacon on the line quite easy to see. Switching the camera on, the search for subjects began.</p>
<p>While there were some mussels on the hull, there were also huge starfish clearing them off. Ling were all about the wreck. Some were quite large. Adult and juvenile eelpout littered the debris. Some were in holes under the plates, but several were sitting out waiting for their picture to be taken. Several large tog made a point of mocking me as they swam by. As usual the large quantities of cunners swam around the openings in the wreck.</p>
<p>I had turned to the right off the anchor line which took me aft. At the stern were the three large shafts where the props had been blown off during salvage operations years ago. The far side of the wreck was uninteresting with no debris or holes. I turned and headed back toward the anchor. I could quickly see the beacon far off in the distance marking the anchor location. This is always a comforting sight. Approaching the line, the three man video team could be seen descending the line preparing for their dive. I took some footage of their approach.</p>
<p>Despite the dive brief, a 3 lb lobster made a point of jumping in front of the camera lens. After taking a few seconds of video, he was invited back to the boat to meet the rest of the crew. Apparently he had not listened to the brief.</p>
<p>Time was up for the first dive, thirty minutes of bottom time. Now it was time for the long ascent. Thirty more minutes of deco. Deep stops were short, and the 80ft stop was right at the thermocline. The warm water felt good. It was 50 deg on the bottom, and 72 on the surface. Most of that change occurred between 70ft-80ft. Once cleared to the 70ft stop, the boat could be clearly seen above. Other divers were visible hanging on the line and deco bar. A quick gas switch at 70ft then there’s not much to do but spend a lot of time staring at the bottom timer.</p>
<p>Approaching the shallower stops, equipment lines became clearly visible hanging from the port side of the boat. Scooters, tanks, hammers and catch bags hung bouncing on the lines. I could see that others had also found lobster on the wreck. One was quite large, five lbs maybe. Small jellyfish floated slowly by. There was not much current, but the boat was swinging back and forth on the anchor line. One minute you were on the left of the line, the next minute, you were on the right. Normally this is not much of an issue, but with a camera, deco bottles catch bag, and reels, you could easily snag the line.</p>
<p>Deco time was up. Now it was time for the worst part of the dive, getting back on the boat. I should have hung my own equipment line over the side. It would have made me lighter. Once on the ladder, it was evident that the wind had picked up a little. The calm seas had turned to 3ft. Not too bad, but hold on tight to the ladder. Trish wanted one more picture, so I tried to smile (tough to do with a reg still in my mouth).</p>
<p>The surface interval went quickly. We ate, and talked. Trish brought out home made pumpkin bread. We swapped sea stories, discussed wrecks and gear configurations. The video team returned, and described where they had gone inside the ship. From all of the discussion, it was apparent that the main tear in the ships hull was to the left of the anchor. That was the destination on the second dive.</p>
<p>We began to gear up and drop into the water. No fanfare this time, just drop in. On the way down it was evident that the current had picked up. The seas were still about 3ft, but you needed to hold onto the line on the way down. At the thermocline, I could see the bubbles rising from another diver. They were coming straight up until they cleared the thermocline, then they continued up and to the right at a 30deg angle. An interesting effect, again I did not think to get footage of it.</p>
<p>The bottom conditions were unchanged. The sun had been in and out all day and right now it was out. There was more light, and the camera appreciated it. Headed to the left, the tear in the hull was only 50ft away. Maybe 30ft high and 20ft-30ft across, it was an inviting sight. Without proper gear or training though, I passed on the opportunity after taking some footage.</p>
<p>The long swim to the bow of the ship was rather uneventful. The debris was not as dense up there, but the anemones on the hull seemed thicker in the brighter light. The ship was 500+ft long, so the trip took a while. The remainder of the hull appeared to be intact.The eelpouts were out in large numbers. They sat on the bottom rather than hiding in their holes. Large tog continued to mock me as they swam lazily by. Out in the sand was found a lone scallop. Excited, I took a bearing and headed out further into the sand, but to no avail. I had the only scallop on the wreck.</p>
<p>Time went quickly, and the long swim had increased my deco obligation. I cut the dive short by a minute or two as the beacon came into view flashing off in the distance. I headed up and over the top of the hull, rising slowly to intercept the anchor line.</p>
<p>Deco was a bit more work this time as the current was moving quickly. Hand over hand was the only way to move up the anchor line. The surface vis had dropped to 40ft, and the seas had obviously come up some more. After climbing aboard, Trish jumped in to pull the hook. The seas had come up to 4+ft. We all stowed our gear and prepared for the ride back. All were amazed at the sight of a scallop, and I eagerly stowed it with the lobster in the cooler.</p>
<p>The trip back was a bit wet. The leeward side of the upper deck only took some light spray as we exchanged more dive stories. Pulling in, we quickly unloaded our gear and loaded our vehicles. Capt. Darryl announced that the next day’s dive was blown out. We said our goodbyes, and headed for home, but not without the requisite tee-shirt souvenirs.</p>

				<small>Wednesday, September 8th, 2004</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p><img src="http://www.sjue.com/images/np_ladder.jpg" align="left"/> Sunday morning the NOAA forecast read 3-4 foot long period swells, winds 5-10 kt. That can be good and bad. On the surface the swells don’t bother the boat much, but can wreak havoc on the bottom with surge and low vis. The sky was about 50% sunshine with high hazy clouds wondering through.</p>
<p>The dive today was off the Spring Tide in Brielle. Capitan Ron and the mate John were on the boat welcoming the arrivals. I had showed up to the dock a little behind schedule, but soon learned the DM was even later. I had plenty of time to load my gear and talk about the upcoming dive. The trip was to the Ayuruoca commonly known as the Oil Wreck. She sunk during the war after a collision. She had been running with her light out to avoid submarine attack. She landed on the bottom in 175 fsw of the mud hole. She was intact and upright with the deck at 150 ft and the masts extending up to 80 ft.</p>
<p>Once my gear was stowed, I sat with the other divers and crew waiting the DM and last two intrepid souls. Once they arrived and started loading gear, I started to notice a few Argon bottles showing up. A quick inspection of the tank labels soon confirmed my suspicions. At least two of the divers were on Mix. Without proper training, air was my limit for this dive. 175 fsw on air, it’s going to be a fun day.</p>
<p>Since the wreck was in the mud hole, I had borrowed a buddy’s HID light. I added it to my gear and did some final checks. The boat was soon underway and we hit the racks and benches for the ride out. Some of the group were generating deco tables and writing them down on slates. Others were assembling gear do to the late arrival.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the site, there was a fishing boat on the front of the wreck. She waved us in. We anchored behind them. The DM jumped in to set the hook, but was unable to make headway in the ripping surface current. The surface water was brown and cloudy, maybe 2ft vis. We threw him a line and pulled him forward to the anchor line. Soon the bottle was up and we jumped in one by one. After doing a final check and switching on the light, it was my turn.</p>
<p>Once over the side I quickly grabbed the down line and started to descend. Once below 5 ft, the vis cleared and the current stopped. The anchor line could be clearly seen for 40+ feet descending into the thermocline below. With the current gone it was a simple task to glide down the granny line to the anchor, then down into the darkness. At 90 ft the HID’s light became apparent as the sunlight was quickly eclipsed by the small particles floating in the water column. At 150ft the deck suddenly came into view in the 15ft vis. There was a slight surge, a very slight current, and it was very dark.</p>
<p>As it turns out, we were anchored into a lobster trap. The deck of the ship was littered with them. While waiting on the surface we had seen many buoys off in the distance. Apparently over the years many traps had landed on the deck and been snared by the ship. The deck was now covered in rope and lobster traps. Descriptions of monofilament webs quickly came to mind. Tying off a reel, I carefully started to navigate the deck. Trying to avoid entanglement, I struggled to determine where on the wreck we were located.</p>
<p>After a few minutes a railing came into view. Up, over and down to the bottom. The vis on the side of the deck was poor as I waved the light back and forth between the hull beside me and the void below. Soon the bottom came into view. It was dark and muddy. Not much character to it. Swimming a few feet into the light current, nothing came into view. The hull beside me was the only item of interest around. It was encrusted with hydroids and muscles. Large starfish were there to pray on the muscles. Ropes were dangling down from the deck above then off into the distance.</p>
<p>Heading back to the deck, the hull did seem to have more character than on the decent, probably just the narcosis fog clearing a little. Once on the deck I did some more investigations of the immediate area around the anchor. There was a mass of rope and traps to the left that prevented me from heading that way. To the right the deck dropped off without a railing to another deck below. We must have been behind the wheelhouse.</p>
<p>The time was up for the first dive, so I reeled in my line, and started up the anchor. At the 100ft stop the water started to get warmer. It was 54 deg on the bottom and 68 deg at 70 ft. The vis also cleared. One of the masts stuck above the thermocline, 30ft off the line. This could be clearly seen in the ambient light. Shutting down the HID to conserve battery, I waited out the stops slowly. It was a two deco bottle dive, so the wait was not long. Once at the 10 ft stop the thick surface layer could be seen again. The surface water was dark and brown, thick with jelly fish. From 10ft to the thermocline at 100 ft the water was green and somewhat clear. My guess was that the surface water was brackish water from the Hudson, headed out to sea. This would explain the color and the current.</p>
<p>Back on the boat, several divers talked about the monofilament, I had not run into any. We swapped stories of what we saw. It was a long wait for next dive. We were entertained watching the fishing boat try to pull out of the wreck. With all that debris, I don’t know how anyone could anchor and pull out again. It took them half an hour to finally get the hook out.</p>
<p>On the way down the line for the second dive, it became apparent that the boat had swung around on the anchor. The line was now wrapped 90 deg around the mast we had seen on the first dive. I was tempted to drop down the mast to the deck, but was concerned with the number of ropes and line hanging from it. I did a quick check to verify that the line was not chaffing on the mast, and went down to the anchor.</p>
<p>This time, after tying my reel, I went up and over the rope mass that covered the wheelhouse. The vis on this side was 20-30 ft, but still very dark. There was a little more surge, but the current was still slight. I swam out for a while examining the structure of the deck, and gear. Hoists stuck up from deck and in some places the deck plates were gone revealing the structure below. Hydroids swayed in the surge, cunners darted in and out of the holes in the wreck. Here and there a tog could be seen popping out of the ships structure. The ship was 468 ft long. I quickly ran out of time before I could reach the bow. Turning around and reeling in line, I quickly arrived back at the anchor, untied the reel and headed up the line.</p>
<p>The 100 ft stop was right at the place where the anchor line wrapped around the mast. The stop was short, but disconcerting. Most of the time was spent trying to keep rope from ensnaring gear. Back at the 80 ft stop, the top of mast was 20 ft away. The current was such that I was facing the crows nest. Several large tog were circling it with many cuunners and small fish hiding in the web of rope. Looking closer there was one huge tog swimming slowly, nibbling at something on the mast. By my estimations he was 3+ ft long (other divers said 4ft). He could still be seen at the 70 ft and 60 ft stops. He was mocking me. The great white hunter would have to come back to this wreck and teach him some respect.</p>
<p>I encountered divers a the 10ft stop. Apparently one diver’s computers had failed, and he was now doing a worst case deco plan. (Don&#8217;t leave the surface without one.) Once the last diver was onboard, John jumped in and pulled the hook. He did not have issues with the mast, but had to ride it up over some lobster buoys. By the time we were underway most of the divers were asleep in the racks or benches. We pulled in and unloaded our gear. This had been another great dive, but no dinner.</p>
