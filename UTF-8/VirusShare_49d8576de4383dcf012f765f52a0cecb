The operators decreed that Sam should play afternoons, and the place isn't open in the afternoon!  A single customer, John Sorenson, who just got off a boat from Denmark, wandered in by mistake one day and was served by the entire skeleton staff of three waiters, a cashier, head waiter, cook and busboy.  In one of these staff photos by got, Sam and the band are seen playing to an attentive audience, consisting of one cat, Hep.  In the other Stan Kenton keeps lonely Sam company, while Nick Callonus, a waiter, stands ready to bring another drink.\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cb\u003ENotes:\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003C\/b\u003E Gottlieb Collection Assignment No. 112\u003Cbr\/\u003EPurchase William P.

Slipping into our Hawaiian shirts, sipping on a Mai Tais, and listening to exotica music amid palm trees, bamboo and a twinkling midnight sky, we took an eager group of 100 though Vancouver’s last remaining original Tiki bar.\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EFashioned at the very beginning of the Tiki craze of the 1950s, the Waldorf is one of the oldest surviving Tiki bars in North America, and one of the last original such establishments left outside of the Hawaiian Islands. A post-war phenomenon, Tiki culture was rooted partially in the nostalgic tropical memories of returned soldiers but also in the erotic fantasies of a middle class fascinated by the exotic and forbidden. The Waldorf’s fabulous Polynesian themed rooms reflect an era when Polynesian ephemera adorned lounges, restaurants, hotels and rumpus rooms. Exotica music was all the rage, and from Broadway musicals to Hollywood movies, North Americans reveled in the allure of the South Pacific Isles. Return with us to a simpler time, of tropical fantasies and strong rum drinks.\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBen Seibel impromptu Iroquois Bridal White Mosaic\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\"1950 fashion\" src=\"http:\/\/farm1.staticflickr.com\/38\/117268366_72834862e8.jpg\" width=\"400\"\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Ci\u003EImage by Patrick Q\u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EThough this looks like something you'd find today at IKEA, it's not new.
