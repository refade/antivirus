The Fluval FX5 A218 offers unparallel filtration power, maximum versatility and incredible control in fine-tuning water characteristics. Fluval FX5 Smart Pump Technology ensures a quiet, efficient operation. This self-priming system provides plug-in-and-start convenience.

The powerful pump then sends it through the multiple levels of media for the cleaning and processing sequence. As water flows back into the aquarium the flared design of the adjustable output nozzle disperses it in multiple directions, agitating the water and creating currents that help break down wastes and prevent them from settling.

This means you can separate the hosing from the FX5 filter in one step. The valve lever can also be used to regulate water flow with no harm to the motor or its components. Three valves are provided: one for the intake, one for the output and one to be used to drain the filter under certain circumstances during the maintenance process.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003EClog-Proof Intake Strainer\u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EThe wide, rounded mouth of the FX5 intake strainer is shaped to siphon water quickly.

These large capacity baskets enable you to stack filtration media in the precise combination of layers that will work best for your aquarium. Use one type of media in each basket, or layer two or three types to suit your aquariums needs. Each basket is lined with a foam insert for effective mechanical pre-filtering. The instant-release T-handles let you lift, then separate the basket stack quickly and easily, making routine maintenance simple. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003EMulti-Directional Output Nozzle\u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EThe flared spout of the adjustable twin output nozzles sends multiple streams of purified water toward all corners of the aquarium, creating currents that agitate the water to break down wastes and help hold them in suspension until they can be drawn into the filter by the intake strainer.

Impeller speed and force are constantly measured to ensure powerful output and energy efficiency. Smart Pump technology is also critical in evacuating any air that may build up in the system. Once every 24 hours, the filter will pause and allow any trapped air to escape, thus maintaining maximum filtration efficiency. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EFluval FX5 Canister Filter Specifications\u003C\/h2\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWattages 230-240V\/50Hz: 48W\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWattages 120V\/60Hz: 50W\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EBiological Volume: 1.5 gallons, 5.9 L\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPump Output: 925 gallons\/hour\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHead Height (max.): 10.8ft\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFilter Circulation*: 563 gallons\/hour\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFiltration Volume: 5.28 gallons, 20 L\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAquarium Capacity: 400 gallons 1,500 liters\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMechanical Area (Foam): 325.5 in.2 2,100 cm2\u003C\/li\u003E\u003C\/ul\u003E*Note: Flow rates were measured with intake and output hoses of the same length and without media. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EFLUVAL FX5 Filter Media Options\u003C\/h2\u003E\u003Ctable cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;\"\u003E\u003Ctbody\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-8RetgBB-lNg\/TuZFlfanZbI\/AAAAAAAABaM\/7GyCyqQNggM\/s1600\/fluval-fx5-media.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" height=\"200\" src=\"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-8RetgBB-lNg\/TuZFlfanZbI\/AAAAAAAABaM\/7GyCyqQNggM\/s200\/fluval-fx5-media.png\" width=\"167\" \/\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003EFluval FX5 Media Option\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003C\/tbody\u003E\u003C\/table\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFluval Polishing Pad – Screens out fine particulates\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFluval Ammonia Remover – Effectively removes ammonia before it can harm fish.\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFluval Foam – Effectively traps and retains solid waste and particulates, allow biological and chemical media to function better.\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EBioMax – Porous ceramic rings that provide a huge surface area for beneficial bacteria to colonize.\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFluval Carbon – Research-grade carbon removes colors, odors and toxins from water.\u003C\/li\u003E\u003C\/ul\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EFluval FX5 External Canister Filter Review\u003C\/h2\u003EThe \u003Ci\u003EFluval FX5 A218 canister filter\u003C\/i\u003E is a great \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/aquascape-aquarium.blogspot.com\/2011\/05\/aquarium-water-filter-size-pump.html\"\u003Eaquarium filter\u003C\/a\u003E but requires regular cleaning - every 1-3 months full filter clean.

Fish squander speedily turns into ammonia which is really toxic to the fish. Between the two sorts of bacteria ammonia is transformed to nitrite and then nitrite is converted to the much less toxic nitrate. Drinking water alterations then maintain the nitrate levels down to an acceptable degree.\r\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\u003Cbr \/\u003EActivated charcoal or ion trade resins are employed in chemical filters.

Most of the modern day filters utilised right now are based upon these filters. They work by pulling water by means of many distinct filter media utilizing an air pump. Compared with other filters available they are not extremely effective but they are reasonable in cost. They are generally utilised today in breeding and hospital tanks.\r\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\u003Cbr \/\u003E2). Undergravel filters (UGF) consist of a grid of plastic pipes with tiny holes every 50 % inch or so. A space of drinking water is created underneath the gravel because the grid sits there. Up to four 'air lifts' little by little pull the squander down through the substrate into the pipes. The theory is that bacteria will break it down there. Below gravel filters use an 'air lift' to pull water by way of them so oxygenation is higher other positive aspects are that they are cheap to purchase and straightforward to set up and operate. One disadvantage is that they normally do not do chemical filtration. Also the small holes in the pipes are easily blocked and then squander tends to build up in the substrate. So you have to remove the filter two or 3 times a calendar year to give it a great clean as well as routinely use a siphonic hoover on the gravel. This indicates that you have to remove most of the substrate to get at the filter. For this purpose on your own, undergravel filters are becoming less typical.\r\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\u003Cbr \/\u003E3) Electricity filters hang on the exterior of the tank and use a pump to pull h2o up into the filter. The h2o falls again into the aquarium right after getting handed by way of mechanical, biological and quite possibly chemical filter media. These filters are quickly gaining popularity with aquarists due to the fact they are productive, marginally less costly than canisters, and a dream to maintain. Because they are exposed to the air they help oxygenate the drinking water.\r\u003Cbr \/\u003E\r\u003Cbr \/\u003E4) Wet\/dry or trickle filters. They are only integrated for completeness.
