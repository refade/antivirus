That may be almost the wild beings which live with us, sharing the same nature where we live. Just the difference is that they live in jungle and we live in our houses. But what can be happened when the animals confront us. It will be a deadly confrontation in which one is sure to die. Here is a video which shows the man who jumped over a crocodile and he was nearly bitten.   The video projects a crowd of people who are seen standing on the side of what appears to be a river with the crocodile just feet away. A man comes from somewhere in the video and has showed his so called foolish stunt in the camera as he jumps over the crocodile and he was almost harmed by the creature. But his foolish attempt can be a serious event in his life since crocodiles are very dangerous animals. The video shows how a foolish man who is over smart and has presented that he can show the talent of jumping over the crocodile.   In the course of jumping he can be also beaten by the crocodile but he was luckily saved since the crocodile missed that moment. If not, the man would have to regret for the deed he has displayed near all. It can be also heard that the crowd shouts at him when he has done that stupid act. He should think twice when he had thought to such stunt but he was lucky enough that the crocodile did not do anything to him.

The most essential thing is that they need help. In that case, here is the helper who is the fisherman by the profession and he has helped to not to a human but would be mother stingray. The moment which is captured in the video is very heart touching since he has helped to the mother stingray so that she can give birth.   The fisherman has caught so that he can help the stingray to deliver the pups on the board his boat but the fisherman has caught the stingray so that he can help her and then he let all of the family go to the sea. Calvin Conger was out fishing with his family when they caught the ray and then they saw the stingray has prodded its stomach and they realize that the fish is about to give birth to two baby stingrays.   The female ray was caught so that he can help her. He noticed that there is a second stinger out of his behind and then he noticed that it is her pup which is struggling hard to come in the world. Then the fisherman stepped in, pushing the ray’s belly while the Calvin’s mother Valerie recorded the bizarre incident. Stingrays are ovoviviparous which means they carry litters of young inside them numbering up to 13 which feed on individual yolk sacks. It is also said that female rays are capable of storing a male ray's sperm inside their bodies without getting pregnant for years before impregnating themselves at a later date. Luckily the stingray met the fisherman and she was helped to deliver her pups."},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/nepalifilmblog.blogspot.com\/feeds\/1636273181126753573\/comments\/default","title":"Post Comments"},{"rel":"replies","type":"text/html","href":"http:\/\/nepalifilmblog.blogspot.com\/2014\/07\/the-adorable-moment-when-fisherman.html#comment-form","title":"0 Comments"},{"rel":"edit","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/feeds\/7505485602086692817\/posts\/default\/1636273181126753573"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/feeds\/7505485602086692817\/posts\/default\/1636273181126753573"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http:\/\/nepalifilmblog.blogspot.com\/2014\/07\/the-adorable-moment-when-fisherman.html","title":"The adorable moment when the fisherman helps stingray to give birth to her pups"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"menuka bharati"},"uri":{"$t":"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/117288787013995820557"},"email":{"$t":"noreply@blogger.com"},"gd$image":{"rel":"http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail","width":"32","height":"32","src":"\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/-7D6rHrpONx0\/AAAAAAAAAAI\/AAAAAAAAABU\/12Mj93uZKhI\/s512-c\/photo.jpg"}}],"thr$total":{"$t":"0"}},{"id":{"$t":"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7505485602086692817.post-59314925744113510"},"published":{"$t":"2014-07-28T06:45:00.004-07:00"},"updated":{"$t":"2014-07-28T06:45:53.877-07:00"},"category":[{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"All"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"News"}],"title":{"type":"text","$t":"Leaders and parliament members in parliament hall"},"content":{"type":"html","$t":"\u003Cimg alt=\"Dog Escape Prank\" src=\"http:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Xa9BZB3-yFM\/hqdefault.jpg\" height=\"150\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 1px;\" width=\"200\" \/\u003E[id]http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Xa9BZB3-yFM[\/id] News is a National bulletin News that covers happenings in National, regional and International arena.
