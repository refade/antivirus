The automaker went all out, put journalists, executives and car dealers on a three-story paddle boat and sent us on a two-hour journey across San Francisco Bay. I had a beer and two dumplings. We were headed to a long-vacated Ford manufacturing plant in Richmond, CA.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the time we reached our destination, the sun had set and Audi was ready to begin. Suddenly, in front of the boat, Intel’s Shooting Star drones put on a show that ended with Audi’s trademark four ring logo. The show continued as music pounded inside the warehouse, and just before the reveal of the e-tron, Intel’s Shooting Star Minis celebrated the occasion with a light show a couple of feet above attendees’ heads.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat’s when one hit me.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENatalie Cheung, GM of Intel Drone Light Shows, told me they knew when one drone failed to land on its zone that one went rogue. According to Cheung, the Shooting Star Mini drones were designed with safety in mind.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“The drone frame is made of flexible plastics, has prop guards, and is very small,” she said. “The drone itself can fit in the palm of your hand. In addition to safety being built into the drone, we have systems and procedures in place to promote safety. For example, we have visual observers around the space watching the drones in flight and communicating with the pilot in real-time. We have built-in software to regulate the flight paths of the drones.”\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the crash, I assumed someone from Audi or Intel would be around to collect the lost drone, but no one did, and at the end of the show, I was unable to find someone who knew where I could find the Intel staff. I notified my Intel contacts first thing the following morning and provided a local address where they could get the drone. As of publication, the drone is still on my desk.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have covered Intel’s Shooting Star program \u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/11\/16\/intel-and-disney-paint-the-sky\/\"\u003Esince its first public show at Disney World in 2016\u003C\/a\u003E. It’s a fascinating program and one of the most impressive uses of drones I’ve seen. The outdoor shows, which have been used at The Super Bowl and Olympics, are breathtaking. Hundreds of drones take to the sky and perform a seemingly impossible dance and then return home. A sophisticated program designates the route of each drone and GPS ensures each is where it’s supposed to be and it’s controlled by just one person.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntel launched \u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/01\/08\/watch-intels-drones-play-the-piano-and-dance-in-the-air\/\"\u003Ean indoor version of the Shooting Star program\u003C\/a\u003E at CES in 2018. The concept is the same, but these drones do not use GPS to determine their location. The result is something even more magical than the outside version because with the Shooting Star Minis, the drones are often directly above the viewers. It’s an incredible experience to watch drones dance several feet overhead. It feels slightly dangerous. That’s the draw.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that poses a safety concern.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg class=\"size-large wp-image-1715313 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/intel-shooting-star-mini.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"453\" \/\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe drone that hit me is light and mostly plastic. It weighs very little and is about 6-inches by 4-inches. A cage surrounds the bottom of the rotors though not the top. If there’s a power button, I can’t find it. The full-size drones are made out of plastic and Styrofoam.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESafety has always been baked into the Shooting Star programs but I’m not sure the current protocols are enough.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was seated on the floor along the back of the venue. Most of the attendees where standing, taking selfies with the performing drones. It was a lovely show.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the drone came down on my head, it tumbled onto the floor and the rotors continued to spin. A member of the catering staff was walking behind the barrier I was sitting against, reached out and touched the spinning rotors. I’m sure she’s fine, but when her finger touched the spinning rotor, she jumped in surprise. At this point, seconds after it crashed, the drone was upside down, and like an upturned beetle, continued to operate for a few seconds until the rotors shut off.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be clear, I was not hurt. And that’s not the point. Drone swarm technology is fascinating and could lead to incredible use cases. Swarms of drones could quickly and efficiently inspect industrial equipment and survey crops. And they make for great shows in outside venues. But are they ready to be used inside, above people’s heads? I’m already going bald. I don’t need help.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?a=s9AS5pWj3Ec:X6WW918svjY:V_sGLiPBpWU\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?i=s9AS5pWj3Ec:X6WW918svjY:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\" \/\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?a=s9AS5pWj3Ec:X6WW918svjY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?i=s9AS5pWj3Ec:X6WW918svjY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\" \/\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?a=s9AS5pWj3Ec:X6WW918svjY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" \/\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/3novices\"\u003EFor details check twitter.com\/3novices\u003C\/a\u003E"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/3novices.blogspot.com\/feeds\/7720695423458100035\/comments\/default","title":"Post Comments"},{"rel":"replies","type":"text/html","href":"http:\/\/3novices.blogspot.com\/2018\/09\/3novicesan-intel-drone-fell-on-my-head.html#comment-form","title":"0 Comments"},{"rel":"edit","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/feeds\/338394477269451686\/posts\/default\/7720695423458100035"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/feeds\/338394477269451686\/posts\/default\/7720695423458100035"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http:\/\/3novices.blogspot.com\/2018\/09\/3novicesan-intel-drone-fell-on-my-head.html","title":"3Novices:An Intel drone fell on my head during a light show"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"3novices"},"uri":{"$t":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/profile\/11914359123337263458"},"email":{"$t":"noreply@blogger.com"},"gd$image":{"rel":"http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail","width":"16","height":"16","src":"https:\/\/img1.blogblog.com\/img\/b16-rounded.gif"}}],"thr$total":{"$t":"0"},"gd$extendedProperty":[{"name":"commentSource","value":"1"},{"name":"commentModerationMode","value":"FILTERED_POSTMOD"}]},{"id":{"$t":"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-338394477269451686.post-200210018074349239"},"published":{"$t":"2018-09-19T05:06:00.001+05:30"},"updated":{"$t":"2018-09-19T05:06:12.527+05:30"},"category":[{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"Gadgets"}],"title":{"type":"text","$t":"3Novices:Committed to privacy, Snips founder wants to take on Alexa and Google, with blockchain"},"content":{"type":"html","$t":"\u003Cp class=\"dropcap\"\u003EEarlier this year we saw the headlines of how the users of popular voice assistants like Alexa and \u003Ca class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/siri\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"siri\"\u003ESiri\u003C\/a\u003E and continue to face issues when their private data is compromised, or even sent to random people.

After all, Amazon announced the launch of Alexa for Hospitality, its Alexa system for hotels, in June. News stories like this simply reinforce the idea that voice control is seeping into our daily lives.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe French startup \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/Snips.ai\"\u003ESnips\u003C\/a\u003E thinks it might have an answer to the issue of security and data privacy. Its built its software to run 100% on-device, independently from the cloud. As a result, user data is processed on the device itself, acting as a potentially stronger guarantor of privacy. Unlike centralized assistants like Alexa and Google, \u003Ca class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/snips-2\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"snips-2\"\u003ESnips\u003C\/a\u003E knows nothing about its users.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts approach is convincing investors. To date, Snips has raised €22 million in funding from investors like Korelya Capital, MAIF Avenir, BPI France and Eniac Ventures. Created in 2013 by 3 PhDs, and now employing more than 60 people in Paris and New York, Snips offers its voice assistant technology as a white-labelled solution for enterprise device manufacturers.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt’s tested its theories about voice by releasing the result of a consumer poll. The survey of 410 people found that 66% of respondents said they would be apprehensive of using a voice assistant in a hotel room, because of concerns over privacy, 90% said they would like to control the ways corporations use their data, even if it meant sacrificing convenience.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“Сonsumers are increasingly aware of the privacy concerns with voice assistants that rely on cloud storage — and that these concerns will actually impact their usage,” says Dr Rand Hindi, co-founder and CEO at Snips. “However, emerging technologies like blockchain are helping us to create safer and fairer alternatives for voice assistants.”\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIndeed, blockchain is very much part of Snip’s future. As Hindi \u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/25\/snips-announces-an-ico-and-its-own-voice-assistant-device\/?guccounter=1\"\u003Etold TechCrunch in May\u003C\/a\u003E, the company will release a new set of consumer devices independent of its enterprise business. The idea is to create a consumer business that will prompt further enterprise development. At the same time, they will issue a cryptographic token via an ICO to incentivize developers to improve the Snips platform, as an alternative to using data from consumers. The theory goes that this will put it at odds with the approach used by Google and Amazon, who are constantly criticised for invading our private lives merely to improve their platforms.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a result Hindi believes that as voice-controlled devices become an increasingly common sight in public spaces, there could be a significant shift in public opinion about how their privacy is being protected.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn an interview conducted last month with TechCrunch, Hindi told me the company’s plans for its new consumer product are well advanced, and will be designed from the beginning to be improved over time using a combination of decentralized machine learning and cryptography.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy using blockchain technology to share data, they will be able to train the network “without ever anybody sending unencrypted data anywhere,” he told me.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd ‘training the network” is where it gets interesting. By issuing a cryptographic token for developers to use, Hindi says they will incentivize devs to work on their platform and process data in a decentralized fashion. They are starting from a good place. He claims they already have 14,000 developers on the platform who will be further incentivized by a token economy.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“Otherwise people have no incentive to process that data in a decentralized fashion, right?” he says.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“We got into blockchain because we’re trying to find a way to get people to participate in decentralized machine learning. We’ve been wanting to get into consumer [devices] for a couple of years but didn’t really figure out the end goal because we had always had this missing element which was: how do you keep making it better over time.”\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“This is the main argument for \u003Ca class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/google\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"google\"\u003EGoogle\u003C\/a\u003E and Amazon to pretend that you need to send your data to them, to make the service better.

I like its chunky design (though it is perhaps a mite too thick), I like its round buttons and layout, I like its deliberate limitations. But it and other would-be minimal phones, in my opinion, are too slavish in their imitations of devices from years past. What we want is minimalism, not (just) nostalgia. We want the most basic useful features of a phone without all the junk that comes with them.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cdiv id=\"attachment_1603019\" style=\"width: 630px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\u003E\u003Cimg class=\"wp-image-1603019 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/z5uegeqy5jzrdbwdvugo.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" \/\u003E\u003Cp class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003EThe Light Phone 2 and its nice e-ink screen.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor me, that means including a couple things that these devices tend to eschew.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne is modern messaging. SMS is bad for a lot of reasons. Why not include a thin client to pass text to a messaging service like WhatsApp or Messenger? Of course iMessage is off limits — thanks, Apple — but we could at least get a couple of the cross-platform apps on board. It doesn’t hurt the minimalist nature of the phone, in my opinion, if it connects to a modern messaging infrastructure. No need for images or gifs or anything — just text is fine.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo is maps. We sure as hell didn’t have maps on our featurephones back in the day, but you better believe we wanted them. Basic mapping is one of the things we rely on our phones for every day. Whatever’s on this minimal phone doesn’t have to be a full-stack affair with recommendations, live traffic, and so on — just location and streets, and maybe an address or lat\/long lookup, like you’d see on an old monochrome GPS unit. I don’t need my phone to tell me where to eat — just keep me from getting lost.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThree, and this is just me, I’d like some kind of synchronizing note app or the ability to put articles from Pocket or whatever on there. The e-ink screen on the Light Phone is a great opportunity for this very specific type of consumption. Neither of the companies here seems likely to add this feature, but that doesn’t change the fact that it’s one of the few things I regularly use my phone for.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELight Phone 2 is possibly getting music, weather, and voice commands, none of which really screams “minimal” to me, nor do they seem trivial to add. Ride-share stuff is a maybe, but it’d probably be a pain.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no problem with my phone doing just what a pocketable device needs to do and leaving the more sophisticated stuff to another device. But that pocketable device can’t be \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C\/em\u003E dumb.

The funding will be used for expanding into new international markets, as well as developing new products for large venues, including airports and “last-mile” sidewalk transportation. The round’s lead investors were SBI Investment, Daiwa Securities Group and WHIZ Partners, with participation from returning investors INCJ, Eight Road Ventures, MSIVC, Nippon Venture Capital, DG Incubation and Mizuho Capital.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis brings \u003Ca class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/whill\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"whill\"\u003EWHILL’s\u003C\/a\u003E total funding so far to about $80 million. Founded in Tokyo in 2012, WHILL plans to open a branch in the European Union and enter 10 new European countries. It also plans to start working with partners on developing autonomous capabilities for its mobility devices, senior marketing manager Jeff Yoshioka told TechCrunch. The company will build its own sensors and cameras to use in its “mobility as a service” program, which allows users to control vehicles and call customer service through a mobile app.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of WHILL’s biggest projects is developing an autonomous personal mobility device system for airports. Yoshioka says that an estimated 20 million people request wheelchairs in U.S. airports each year. This means they need to wait for an airline employee to bring a wheelchair to them and then push them from check-in to their gates. At the same time, it doesn’t give users a lot of flexibility.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe system that WHILL has in mind, on the other hand, would allow individuals to use an app to summon a mobility device over to them. Then they can go wherever they want — coffee shops, restrooms, shops — before heading to the gate without an assistant. Once they are done with the device, it will return to a docking station on its own. WHILL has already begun \u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/news.panasonic.com\/global\/press\/data\/2017\/08\/en170808-6\/en170808-6.html\"\u003Etesting a similar program\u003C\/a\u003E at Tokyo International Airport in partnership with Panasonic.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYoshioka says WHILL will most likely pursue distribution partnerships with U.S. airlines, which are responsible for supplying and maintaining the wheelchair systems in American airports, and airports to build the necessary infrastructure.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlong with airports, WHILL wants to bring its technology to other large venues, including shopping malls and sports arenas, as well as create a system for last-mile transportation. Yoshioka notes that “there are already a lot of companies out there like LimeBike and MoBike that offer bikes and electric scooters, but there’s nothing out there for people with disabilities who can’t use those devices.”\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead, many rely on Ubers or public transportation even for short distances. Like the airport system, WHILL’s last-mile sidewalk system will use autonomous electric vehicles that can be called to users with an app. It faces unique challenges, however, because WHILL’s devices are larger and more expensive than bikes or electric scooters, so the company needs to find safe places to dock them that are still accessible to people with limited mobility. Yoshioka says WHILL likely will focus on partnering with commercial properties to create indoor docking stations.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWHILL’s largest market is still Japan, where it has between 4,000 to 5,000 resellers. In its home market, WHILL’s devices are subsidized by the government and also available for rent. In the U.S., however, many customers need to purchase devices out-of-pocket. To make their products more accessible,\u0026nbsp;WHILL\u0026nbsp;launched the less expensive Model Ci (called the Model C in Europe and Japan) earlier this year. While there is still plenty of room for innovation in the wheelchair market, the Model Ci and other WHILL products compete with devices like the iBot, which can climb stairs, and the Trackchair, designed for off-road use. WHILL’s current products can’t climb stairs, but they do have the advantage of being designed for both indoor and outdoor use, giving users more flexibility, says Yoshioka.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe company also expects demand for its products to grow thanks to a rapidly aging world population, citing statistics that show there are \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.un.org\/en\/sections\/issues-depth\/ageing\/\"\u003Eexpected to be more than 2.1 billion people over the age of 60 by 2050\u003C\/a\u003E, up from about 900 million last year.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“We don’t necessarily see [the other companies] as direct competitors. They definitely do impact sales, because people might want something that climbs stairs instead of having better outdoor capabilities, but I think overall it’s very beneficial for the industry,” Yoshioka adds. “As a company that’s trying to disrupt the industry, it’s nice to have them around because it pushes the industry forward and opens eyes for other manufacturers.”\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?a=-yP727YSCHQ:Mwk7gMWg5DE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?i=-yP727YSCHQ:Mwk7gMWg5DE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\" \/\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?a=-yP727YSCHQ:Mwk7gMWg5DE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?i=-yP727YSCHQ:Mwk7gMWg5DE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\" \/\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?a=-yP727YSCHQ:Mwk7gMWg5DE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" \/\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/3novices\"\u003EFor details check twitter.com\/3novices\u003C\/a\u003E"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/3novices.blogspot.com\/feeds\/7068100575795302928\/comments\/default","title":"Post Comments"},{"rel":"replies","type":"text/html","href":"http:\/\/3novices.blogspot.com\/2018\/09\/3noviceswhill-raises-45m-to-help-people.html#comment-form","title":"0 Comments"},{"rel":"edit","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/feeds\/338394477269451686\/posts\/default\/7068100575795302928"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/feeds\/338394477269451686\/posts\/default\/7068100575795302928"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http:\/\/3novices.blogspot.com\/2018\/09\/3noviceswhill-raises-45m-to-help-people.html","title":"3Novices:WHILL raises $45M to help people with disabilities get around airports and other large venues"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"3novices"},"uri":{"$t":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/profile\/11914359123337263458"},"email":{"$t":"noreply@blogger.com"},"gd$image":{"rel":"http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail","width":"16","height":"16","src":"https:\/\/img1.blogblog.com\/img\/b16-rounded.gif"}}],"thr$total":{"$t":"0"},"gd$extendedProperty":[{"name":"commentSource","value":"1"},{"name":"commentModerationMode","value":"FILTERED_POSTMOD"}]},{"id":{"$t":"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-338394477269451686.post-5520025456866201649"},"published":{"$t":"2018-09-18T03:26:00.001+05:30"},"updated":{"$t":"2018-09-18T03:26:35.243+05:30"},"category":[{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"Gadgets"}],"title":{"type":"text","$t":"3Novices:Not to be overshadowed by the Apple Watch, AliveCor announces a new 6-lead ECG reader"},"content":{"type":"html","$t":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/apple\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apple\"\u003EApple’s\u003C\/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/09\/12\/apple-watch-series-4-can-detect-afib-and-perform-an-ecg\/\"\u003Eannouncement\u003C\/a\u003E last week of a Watch with an FDA-approved ECG reader to track heart health \u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/09\/12\/apples-watch-isnt-the-first-with-an-ekg-reader-but-it-will-matter-to-more-consumers\/\"\u003Elooked to be\u003C\/a\u003E the undoing of original ECG reader company AliveCor.

The printer – essentially an upgrade to traditional stereolithography (SLA) printers – uses a single frame of light to create layers of 25 microns.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost SLA printers use a laser or DLP to shine a pattern on the resin. The light hardens the resin instantly, creating a layer of material that the printer then pulls up and out as the object grows. The UV LCD in the $2,699 Inkspire throws an entire layer at a time and is nine times more precise than standard SLA systems. It can print 20 to 36 millimeters per hour and the system can print objects in serial, allowing you to to print hundreds of thousands of small objects per month.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“The printer is also perfect for rapid prototyping of tiny yet incredibly detailed products like jewelry or dental prostheses. But there are more possible applications,” said co-founder Marcin Olchanowski. “Working with relatively small models like HDMI cover caps, one Zortrax Inkspire can 3D print 77 of them in 1h 30min. 30 printers working together in a 3D printing farm can offer an approximate monthly output of 360,000 to over 500,000 parts (depending on how many shifts per day are scheduled).

We see huge prospects of development for resin 3D printing technology, because nowadays customers expect the higher quality of printed models.”\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe company sells 6,500 printers yearly and will see $13.7 million in revenue this year.

We have contacted Amazon and Getty to ask and will update this post as we learn more.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs Getty describes it, the images will appear to enhance how Alexa — Amazon’s AI-based assistant — responds to users’ queries “to shape the visual style of Alexa.”\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“Our premier collection of editorial, creative and archival content is a natural fit for Amazon’s Echo products, bringing best-in-class visuals to Echo users,” said\u0026nbsp;\u003Cspan class=\"xn-person\"\u003EPeter Orlowsky\u003C\/span\u003E, SVP of strategic development, Getty Images, in a statement. “We are honored to unite with Echo’s screen-based products and to use our deep library of content to give Alexa her best look yet.”\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESearches will include both current affairs as well as general knowledge. (Some examples Getty gives: pictures of the winners from the Academy Awards as an answer to “who won”; pictures of cities in answer to “What’s the capital of this or that country”; pictures of a recent touchdown or football goal; and so on.)\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe deal is an interesting move for a few reasons. For Amazon, it will give the company a wide catalog of images to compel people to use (and buy!) the Echo Show and Echo Spot either in addition to or even instead of the lower-priced audio-only echo devices.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast year after the Echo Show launched, there was some \u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/digiday.com\/marketing\/marketers-find-new-video-platform-amazon-echo-show\/\"\u003Eearly criticism\u003C\/a\u003E that there weren’t enough compelling Skills (Echo apps) being built for the screen-based device. While there are more of these Skills now, the voice-based Echo speakers \u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/03\/07\/47-3-million-u-s-adults-have-access-to-a-smart-speaker-report-says\/\"\u003Econtinue to be the company’s mainstay product\u003C\/a\u003E — even if it appears that Google Home sales have more recently \u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/www.canalys.com\/newsroom\/google-beats-amazon-to-first-place-in-smart-speaker-market?campaignname=google\"\u003Eoutpaced those of the Echo\u003C\/a\u003E — and so this could potentially help Amazon find its feet and sales groove with the screen-based products.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is also an interesting play here in terms of how Amazon hopes to get an early advance on visual search and establishing a stronger basic app for it for its devices. A year ago, we \u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/09\/28\/google-homescreen\/\"\u003Ereported\u003C\/a\u003E that Google was working on a screen-based Home competitor to the Echo Show, and now reports say that this is \u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/08\/17\/google-said-to-be-releasing-its-own-smart-display-this-year\/\"\u003Elikely to make an appearance before the holidays this year\u003C\/a\u003E.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat means there is a very strong case for Amazon to get its own product in order and looking a little more impressive before Google — a search giant first and foremost — steals a march.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the side of Getty, the company has for years been trying out different ideas to generate revenues from its vast image catalog. Many of these haven’t really panned out — as evidenced by the fact that the Getty family picked up an asset for $3 billion from an owner that had paid $3.3 billion for it — but the sheer numbers associated with the business — over 300 million images, 200 million digitised — also indicate that there is an inherent value as well.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis, in effect, gives Getty a shot (sorry for the pun) at providing another way of making its assets relevant and valuable, as a lever to help Amazon compete against the mighty Google.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt’s notable to me that the press release had no statement directly from Amazon in it. I’ve asked Amazon for a comment, but as you can see from other integrations — such as \u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/09\/13\/mapillary-rekognition-amazon\/\"\u003Elast week’s news from Mapillary\u003C\/a\u003E — sometimes Amazon prefers to remain a silent partner in its collaborations in order to keep its feature and product cards close to its collective chest.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?a=D75LZXJ9D14:7HDbuMbJ49k:V_sGLiPBpWU\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?i=D75LZXJ9D14:7HDbuMbJ49k:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\" \/\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?a=D75LZXJ9D14:7HDbuMbJ49k:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?i=D75LZXJ9D14:7HDbuMbJ49k:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\" \/\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?a=D75LZXJ9D14:7HDbuMbJ49k:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" \/\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/3novices\"\u003EFor details check twitter.com\/3novices\u003C\/a\u003E"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/3novices.blogspot.com\/feeds\/739822858795846419\/comments\/default","title":"Post Comments"},{"rel":"replies","type":"text/html","href":"http:\/\/3novices.blogspot.com\/2018\/09\/3novicesamazon-taps-getty-to-provide.html#comment-form","title":"0 Comments"},{"rel":"edit","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/feeds\/338394477269451686\/posts\/default\/739822858795846419"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/feeds\/338394477269451686\/posts\/default\/739822858795846419"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http:\/\/3novices.blogspot.com\/2018\/09\/3novicesamazon-taps-getty-to-provide.html","title":"3Novices:Amazon taps Getty to provide images for visual searches on the Echo Show and Echo Spot"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"3novices"},"uri":{"$t":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/profile\/11914359123337263458"},"email":{"$t":"noreply@blogger.com"},"gd$image":{"rel":"http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail","width":"16","height":"16","src":"https:\/\/img1.blogblog.com\/img\/b16-rounded.gif"}}],"thr$total":{"$t":"0"},"gd$extendedProperty":[{"name":"commentSource","value":"1"},{"name":"commentModerationMode","value":"FILTERED_POSTMOD"}]},{"id":{"$t":"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-338394477269451686.post-5799923023324687808"},"published":{"$t":"2018-09-15T23:51:00.001+05:30"},"updated":{"$t":"2018-09-15T23:51:25.472+05:30"},"category":[{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"Gadgets"}],"title":{"type":"text","$t":"3Novices:Everyday home gear made smart"},"content":{"type":"html","$t":"\u003Cdiv class=\"article__contributor-byline\"\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"contributor-byline__contributor\"\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"byline__author\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"byline__author-name\"\u003EMakula Dunbar\u003C\/span\u003E \u003Cspan class=\"byline__author-title\" style=\"display: block;\"\u003EContributor\u003C\/span\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"contributor-byline__bio\"\u003EMakula Dunbar is a writer with \u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/thewirecutter.com\"\u003EWirecutter\u003C\/a\u003E.\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"contributor-byline__more-articles\"\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"more-articles-title\"\u003EMore posts by this contributor\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cul class=\"more-articles-list\"\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/09\/03\/wireless-headphones-and-earbuds-to-fit-your-budget\/\"\u003EWireless headphones and earbuds to fit your budget\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/08\/01\/back-to-college-tech-for-minimalists-and-the-over-prepared\/\"\u003EBack-to-college tech for minimalists and the over-prepared\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/li\u003E\u003C\/ul\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEditor’s note:\u003C\/strong\u003E \u003Cem\u003EThis post was done in partnership with\u003C\/em\u003E \u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/thewirecutter.com\/?utm_source=techcrunch\u0026amp;utm_medium=referral\u0026amp;utm_campaign=syndication\u0026amp;utm_content=smart-home\"\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWirecutter\u003C\/em\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E\u003Cem\u003E.

The iPhone 6S was the latest and greatest, and of course fixed a few of the problems Apple had kindly introduced with the entirely new design of the 6. But for me the SE was a perfect match.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee, I’ve always loved the iPhone design that began with the 4. That storied phone is perhaps best remembered for being left in a bar ahead of release and leaked by Gizmodo — which is too bad, because for once the product was worthy of the lavish unveiling Apple now bestows on every device it puts out.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 4 established an entirely new industrial design aesthetic that was at once instantly recognizable and highly practical. Gone were the smooth, rounded edges and back of the stainless original iPhone (probably the second-best phone Apple made) and the jellybean-esque 3G and 3GS.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1712370\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/iphone_se-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" \/\u003EIn the place of those soft curves were hard lines and uncompromising geometry: a belt of metal running around the edge, set off from the glass sides by the slightest of steps. It highlighted and set off the black glass of the screen and bezel, producing a of specular outline from any angle.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe camera was flush and the home button (RIP) sub-flush, entirely contained within the body, making the device perfectly flat both front and back. Meanwhile the side buttons boldly stood out. Volume in bold, etched circles; the mute switch easy to find but impossible to accidentally activate; the power button perfectly placed for a reaching index finger. Note that all these features are directly pointed at usability: making things easier, better, more accessible, while also being attractive and cohesive as parts of a single object.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompared to the iPhone 4, every single other phone, including Samsung’s new “iPhone killer” Galaxy S, was a cheap-looking mess of plastic, incoherently designed or at best workmanlike. And don’t think I’m speaking as an Apple fanboy; I was not an iPhone user at the time. In fact, I was probably still using \u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2010\/07\/27\/requiem-for-the-g1\/\"\u003Emy beloved G1\u003C\/a\u003E — talk about beauty and the beast!\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe design was strong enough that it survived the initially awkward transition to a longer screen in the 5, and with that generation it also gained the improved rear side that alleviated the phone’s unfortunate tendency towards… well, shattering.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1712374\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/iphone_se-7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"664\" \/\u003EThe two-tone grey iPhone 5S, however, essentially left no room for improvement. And after 4 years, it was admittedly perhaps time to freshen things up a bit. Unfortunately, what Apple ended up doing was subtracting all personality from the device while adding nothing but screen space.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 6 was, to me, simply ugly. It was reminiscent of the plethora of boring Android phones at the time — merely higher quality than them, not different. The 6S was similarly ugly, and the 7 through 8 somehow further banished any design that set themselves apart, while reversing course on some practical measures in allowing an increasingly large camera bump and losing the headphone jack. The X, at least, looked a bit different.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1712372\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/iphone_se-5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" \/\u003EBut to return to the topic at hand, it was after the 6S that Apple had introduced the SE. Although it nominally stood for “Special Edition,” the name was also a nod to the Macintosh SE. Ironically given the original meaning of “System Expansion,” the new SE was the opposite: essentially an iPhone 6S in the body of a 5S, complete with improved camera, Touch ID sensor, and processor. The move was likely intended as a sort of lifeboat for users who still couldn’t bring themselves to switch to the drastically redesigned, and considerably larger, new model.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would take time, Apple seems to have reasoned, to convert these people, the types who rarely buy first generation Apple products and cherish usability over novelty. So why not coddle them a bit through this difficult transition?\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe SE appealed not just to the nostalgic and neophobic, but simply people who prefer a smaller phone. I don’t have particularly large or small hands, but I preferred this highly pocketable, proven design to the new one for a number of reasons.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1712373\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/iphone_se-6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"643\" \/\u003EFlush camera so it doesn’t get scratched up? Check. Normal, pressable home button? Check. Flat, symmetrical design? Check. Actual edges to hold onto? Check. Thousands of cases already available? Check — although I didn’t use one for a long time. The SE is best without one.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the time, the iPhone SE was more compact and better looking than anything Apple offered, while making almost no compromises at all in terms of functionality. The only possible objection was its size, and that was (and is) a matter of taste.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was the best object Apple ever designed, filled with the best tech it had ever developed.

Ever since the 6, it seems to me that Apple has only drifted, casting about for something to captivate its users the way the iPhone 4’s design and new graphical capabilities did, all the way back in 2010. It honed that design to a cutting edge and then, when everyone expected the company to leap forward, it tiptoed instead, perhaps afraid to spook the golden goose.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo me the SE was Apple allowing itself one last victory lap on the back of a design it would never surpass. It’s understandable that it would not want to admit, this many years on, that anyone could possibly prefer something it created nearly a decade ago to its thousand-dollar flagship — a device, I feel I must add, that not only compromises visibly in its design (I’ll never own a notched phone if I can help it) but backpedals on practical features used by millions, like Touch ID and a 3.5mm headphone jack. This is in keeping with similarly user-unfriendly choices made elsewhere in its lineup.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo while I am disappointed in Apple, I’m not surprised. After all, it’s disappointed me for years. But I still have my SE, and I intend to keep it for as long as possible.

And don’t worry, there is a physical slider you can use to shut down the camera whenever you want.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Link View also made me appreciate Google’s Assistant routines more (and my colleague Lucas Matney found the same when he \u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/07\/26\/review-lenovos-google-smart-display-is-pretty-and-intelligent\/\"\u003Etried out the Lenovo Smart Display\u003C\/a\u003E). And it’s just a bit easier to look at the weather graphics instead of having the Assistant rattle off the temperature for the next couple of days.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe the biggest letdown, though (and this isn’t JBL’s, fault but a feature Google needs to enable) is that you can’t add a smart display to your Google Assistant groups. That means you can’t use it as part of your all-house Google Home audio system, for example. It’s an odd omission for sure, given the Link View’s focus on sound, but my understanding is that the same holds true for the Lenovo Smart Display. If this is a deal breaker for you, then I’d hold off on buying a Google Assistant smart display for the time being.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1712084\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/00100dPORTRAIT_00100_BURST20180913100236774_COVER.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"602\" \/\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can, however, use the display as a Chromecast receiver to play music from your phone or watch videos. While you are not using it, the display can show the current time or simply go to blank.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing that doesn’t work on smart displays yet is Google’s continued “conversation feature,” which lets you add a second command without having to say “OK, Google” again. For now, the smart displays only work in English, too.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I first heard about these smart displays, I wasn’t sure if they were going to be useful. Turns out, they are. I do live in the Google Assistant ecosystem, though, and I’ve got a few Google Homes set up around my house. If you’re looking to expand your Assistant setup, then the Link View is a nice addition — and if you’re just getting started (or only need one Assistant-enabled speaker\/display), then opting for a smart display over a smart speaker may just be the way to go, assuming you can stomach the extra cost.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"embed breakout\"\u003E\u003Cblockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"e3oQDM3kBJ\"\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/07\/26\/review-lenovos-google-smart-display-is-pretty-and-intelligent\/\"\u003EReview: Lenovo’s Google Smart Display is pretty and intelligent\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\u003C\/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ciframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/07\/26\/review-lenovos-google-smart-display-is-pretty-and-intelligent\/embed\/#?secret=e3oQDM3kBJ\" data-secret=\"e3oQDM3kBJ\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" title=\"“Review: Lenovo’s Google Smart Display is pretty and intelligent” — TechCrunch\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"\u003E\u003C\/iframe\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?a=YSY_B6sdrAA:BHkeAMopxwA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?i=YSY_B6sdrAA:BHkeAMopxwA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\" \/\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?a=YSY_B6sdrAA:BHkeAMopxwA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?i=YSY_B6sdrAA:BHkeAMopxwA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\" \/\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?a=YSY_B6sdrAA:BHkeAMopxwA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" \/\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/3novices\"\u003EFor details check twitter.com\/3novices\u003C\/a\u003E"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/3novices.blogspot.com\/feeds\/7456997925083346919\/comments\/default","title":"Post Comments"},{"rel":"replies","type":"text/html","href":"http:\/\/3novices.blogspot.com\/2018\/09\/3novicesjbls-smart-display-combines.html#comment-form","title":"0 Comments"},{"rel":"edit","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/feeds\/338394477269451686\/posts\/default\/7456997925083346919"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/feeds\/338394477269451686\/posts\/default\/7456997925083346919"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http:\/\/3novices.blogspot.com\/2018\/09\/3novicesjbls-smart-display-combines.html","title":"3Novices:JBL’s smart display combines Google smarts with good sound"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"3novices"},"uri":{"$t":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/profile\/11914359123337263458"},"email":{"$t":"noreply@blogger.com"},"gd$image":{"rel":"http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail","width":"16","height":"16","src":"https:\/\/img1.blogblog.com\/img\/b16-rounded.gif"}}],"thr$total":{"$t":"0"},"gd$extendedProperty":[{"name":"commentSource","value":"1"},{"name":"commentModerationMode","value":"FILTERED_POSTMOD"}]}]}});
