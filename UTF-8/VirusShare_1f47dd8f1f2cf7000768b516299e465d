And we have been long-term focused, not short-term focused, in making the investment. The ‘hype’ in our decision (the non-zero answer) is that\u0026nbsp;\u003Cspan class=\"il\"\u003EBird\u003C\/span\u003E\u0026nbsp;has built the best product in the market and while we kept meeting with more startups wanting to invest in the space — we kept coming back to\u0026nbsp;\u003Cspan class=\"il\"\u003EBird\u003C\/span\u003E\u0026nbsp;as the best company. So in that sense, the hype from consumers is real and was a part of the decision. On unit economics: We view the first product as an MVP (as the company is less than a year old) — and while the unit economics are encouraging, they played a part of the investment decision but we know it is not even the first inning in this market.”\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere’s certainly an argument to be made for Bird, whose scooters you’ll see pretty much all over the place in cities like Los Angeles. For trips that are just a few miles down wide roads or sidewalks, where you aren’t likely to run into anyone, a quick scan of a code and a hop on a Bird may be worth the few bucks in order to save a few minutes crossing those considerably long blocks. Users can grab a bird that they see and start going right away if they are running late, and it does potentially alleviate the pressure of calling a car for short distances in traffic, where a scooter may actually make more sense physically to get from point A to point B than a car.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are some considerable hurdles going forward, both theoretical and in effect. In San Francisco, though just a small slice of the United States metropolitan area population, the company is facing significant pushback from the local government, and scooters for the time being \u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/24\/bird-lime-spin-electric-scooters-san-francisco\/\"\u003Ehave been kicked off the sidewalks\u003C\/a\u003E.

The first trial led to an Apple victory. Samsung had to \u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2012\/08\/24\/apple-wins-patent-ruling-as-jury-finds-samsung-infringes\/\"\u003Epay $1 billion\u003C\/a\u003E.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office later invalidated one of Apple’s patents.

They both sell smartphones, laptops and other electronics devices. But they also work together on various projects.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn particular, the iPhone X is the first iPhone with an OLED display.

Both products had all of the Sonos highlights – great sound, amazing interfaces, and easy setup – but the Base had too much surface area for more elegant installations and the Bar was too long while still sporting an aesthetic that harkened back to 2008 Crutchfield catalogs.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe $399 Beam is Sonos’ answer to that and it is more than just a pretty box. The speaker includes Alexa – and promised \u003Ca class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/google\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"google\"\u003EGoogle\u003C\/a\u003E Assistant support – and it improves your TV sound immensely. Designed as an add-on to your current TV, it can stand alone or connect with the Sonos subwoofer and a few satellite surround speakers for a true surround sound experience. It truly shines alone, however, thanks to its small size and more than acceptable audio range.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo use the Beam you bring up an iOS or \u003Ca class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/android\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"android\"\u003EAndroid\u003C\/a\u003E app to display your \u003Ca class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/spotify\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"spotify\"\u003ESpotify,\u003C\/a\u003E Apple Music, Amazon, and Pandora accounts (this is a small sampling. Sonos supports more.) You select a song or playlist and start listening. Then, when you want to watch TV, the speaker automatically flips to TV mode – including speech enhancement features that actually work – when the TV is turned on. An included tuning system turns your phone into a scanner that improves the room audio automatically.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe range is limited by the Beam’s size and shape and there is very little natural bass coming out of this thing. However, in terms of range the Beam is just fine. It can play an action movie with a bit of thump and then go on to play some light jazz or pop. I’ve had some surprisingly revelatory sessions with the Beam when listening to classic rock and more modern fare and it’s very usable as a home audio center.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Beam is two feet long and 3 inches tall. It comes in black or white and is very unobtrusive in aly home theatre setup. Interestingly, the product supports HDMI-ARC aka HDMI Audio Return Channel. This standard, introduced in TVs made in the past five years, allows the TV to automatically output audio and manage volume controls via a single HDMI cable. What this means, however, is you’re going to have a bad time if you don’t have HDMI-ARC.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESonos includes an adapter that can also accept optical audio output but setup requires you to turn off your TV speakers and route all the sound to the optical out. This is a bit of a mess and if you don’t have either of those outputs – HDMI-ARC or optical – then you’re probably in need of a new TV. That said, HDMI-ARC is a bit jarring for first timers but Sonos is sure that enough TVs support it that they can use it instead of optical-only.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Beam doesn’t compete directly with other “smart” speakers like the HomePod. It is very specifically a consumer electronics device, even though it supports AirPlay 2 and Alexa. Sonos makes speakers and good ones at that and that goal has always been front and center. While other speakers may offer a more fully-featured sound in a much smaller package, the Beam offers both great TV audio and great music playback for less than any other higher end soundbar. Whole room audio does get expensive – about $1,200 for a Sub and two satellites – but you can simply add on pieces as you go. One thing, however, is clear: Sonos has always been the best wireless speaker for the money and the Beam is another win for the scrappy and innovative speaker company.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/scaled-6654.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" class=\"breakout alignright size-full wp-image-1663385\" \/\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E[gallery ids=\"1663460,1663461,1663462,1663463\"] [gallery ids=\"1663385,1663386,1663388\"] \u003Cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?a=zS6nQxwrJ1E:tO4wIWSNO60:V_sGLiPBpWU\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?i=zS6nQxwrJ1E:tO4wIWSNO60:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\" \/\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?a=zS6nQxwrJ1E:tO4wIWSNO60:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?i=zS6nQxwrJ1E:tO4wIWSNO60:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\" \/\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?a=zS6nQxwrJ1E:tO4wIWSNO60:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" \/\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/3novices\"\u003EFor details check twitter.com\/3novices\u003C\/a\u003E"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/3novices.blogspot.com\/feeds\/4385576089329762094\/comments\/default","title":"Post Comments"},{"rel":"replies","type":"text/html","href":"http:\/\/3novices.blogspot.com\/2018\/06\/3novicesthe-sonos-beam-is-soundbar.html#comment-form","title":"0 Comments"},{"rel":"edit","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/feeds\/338394477269451686\/posts\/default\/4385576089329762094"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/feeds\/338394477269451686\/posts\/default\/4385576089329762094"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http:\/\/3novices.blogspot.com\/2018\/06\/3novicesthe-sonos-beam-is-soundbar.html","title":"3Novices:The Sonos Beam is the soundbar evolved"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"3novices"},"uri":{"$t":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/profile\/11914359123337263458"},"email":{"$t":"noreply@blogger.com"},"gd$image":{"rel":"http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail","width":"16","height":"16","src":"https:\/\/img1.blogblog.com\/img\/b16-rounded.gif"}}],"thr$total":{"$t":"0"},"gd$extendedProperty":[{"name":"commentSource","value":"1"},{"name":"commentModerationMode","value":"FILTERED_POSTMOD"}]},{"id":{"$t":"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-338394477269451686.post-1492571389716327626"},"published":{"$t":"2018-06-26T19:10:00.001+05:30"},"updated":{"$t":"2018-06-26T19:10:26.011+05:30"},"category":[{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"Gadgets"}],"title":{"type":"text","$t":"3Novices:August can now generate smart entry codes for Airbnb guests"},"content":{"type":"html","$t":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/august-a452\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"august-a452\"\u003EAugust\u003C\/a\u003E Lock is getting into the homesharing industry, making the process of checking in an Airbnb guest a bit easier.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/airbnb\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"airbnb\"\u003EAirbnb\u003C\/a\u003E has done what it can over the past few months to make checking in plain and simple.

This compact, battery-powered DLP projector is their latest creation and it has found a place of honor at our family barbecues.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe projector is actually an \u003Ca class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/android\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"android\"\u003EAndroid\u003C\/a\u003E 7.1 device stuffed into a case about as big as a Bluetooth speaker. A physical lens cap slides down and turns on the system and you control everything from he included remote or the buttons on the top of the device. You can also download an app that mimics a mouse and keyboard for choosing videos and information entry. It projects at a maximum of 300 lumens and projects at 720p. You can also connect an HDMI device like a game console or stick in a USB drive full of videos to view on the fly.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, the real benefit here is the ability to stream from various apps. I have YouTube, \u003Ca class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/netflix\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"netflix\"\u003ENetflix,\u003C\/a\u003E Plex, and other apps installed and you can install almost any other Android app you can imagine. It has speakers built in and you can cast to it via Miracast but you cannot insert a Chromecast.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf all you want to do is throw up a little \u003Cem\u003ESanta Clarita Diet\u003C\/em\u003E or \u003Cem\u003EIce Age\u003C\/em\u003E on a sheet in the back yard, this thing is perfect. Because the brightness is fairly low you need solid twilight or a partially dark room to get a good picture. However, the picture is good enough and it would also make a great presentation device for a closed, dark conference room. Because of its small size and battery life – four hours on a charge – it makes for a great alternative to a full-sized projector or even a standard TV.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt $539 the Mars II is priced on par with other 720p projectors. The primary use case – connecting a computer or console via HDMI – works quite well but streaming user experience is a bit of a mixed bag. Because Anker didn’t modify the Android installation much further than adding a few default apps, some apps require a mouse to use and others can be controlled via the arrow keys on the remote or body of the device. This means that some apps – like Plex, for example – let you pick a video via the arrow keys but require you to press the “mouse” button to begin simulating a mouse cursor on the screen. It’s a bit frustrating, especially in poor lighting conditions.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/IMG_20180623_205655.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" class=\"breakout alignright size-full wp-image-1662470\" \/\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the interesting features is the automatic focus system. Instead of fiddling with a knob or slider, you simply point this at a surface and the system projects a bullseye focus ring until the picture is in focus. The focus changes any time you move the device and sometimes it gets caught up if the screen or projector are moving. However in most cases it works perfectly fine.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike most portable projectors you aren’t buying the Mars II to watch 4K video in 5.1 surround sound. You buy it to offer an alternative to sitting on the couch and watching a movie. That means this is great for on-the-road business presentations, campouts, outdoor movie viewing, and sleepovers. It is cheap and portable enough to be almost disposable and it’s not as heavy and hot as other, larger devices. In short, it can go anywhere, show anything, and works really well. Anker also makes the Mars, a more expensive 1080p device, but this one works just fine for about $400 less – a big drop in just about a year of brisk sales. It’s nice to see a good, low-cost manufacturer dabble in the world of complex consumer electronics and come up with a product that is truly useful and fun.\u003C\/p\u003E[gallery ids=\"1662668,1662666,1662665,1662662,1662661\"] \u003Cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?a=AqJlkqd7MpQ:2xswXBjiDgs:V_sGLiPBpWU\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?i=AqJlkqd7MpQ:2xswXBjiDgs:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\" \/\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?a=AqJlkqd7MpQ:2xswXBjiDgs:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?i=AqJlkqd7MpQ:2xswXBjiDgs:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\" \/\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?a=AqJlkqd7MpQ:2xswXBjiDgs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" \/\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/3novices\"\u003EFor details check twitter.com\/3novices\u003C\/a\u003E"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/3novices.blogspot.com\/feeds\/5155710095370731431\/comments\/default","title":"Post Comments"},{"rel":"replies","type":"text/html","href":"http:\/\/3novices.blogspot.com\/2018\/06\/3novicesanker-mars-ii-projector.html#comment-form","title":"0 Comments"},{"rel":"edit","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/feeds\/338394477269451686\/posts\/default\/5155710095370731431"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/feeds\/338394477269451686\/posts\/default\/5155710095370731431"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http:\/\/3novices.blogspot.com\/2018\/06\/3novicesanker-mars-ii-projector.html","title":"3Novices:Anker Mars II projector promises solid summer fun"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"3novices"},"uri":{"$t":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/profile\/11914359123337263458"},"email":{"$t":"noreply@blogger.com"},"gd$image":{"rel":"http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail","width":"16","height":"16","src":"https:\/\/img1.blogblog.com\/img\/b16-rounded.gif"}}],"thr$total":{"$t":"0"},"gd$extendedProperty":[{"name":"commentSource","value":"1"},{"name":"commentModerationMode","value":"FILTERED_POSTMOD"}]},{"id":{"$t":"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-338394477269451686.post-4871420689444442116"},"published":{"$t":"2018-06-25T19:40:00.001+05:30"},"updated":{"$t":"2018-06-25T19:40:35.778+05:30"},"category":[{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"Gadgets"}],"title":{"type":"text","$t":"3Novices:Apple reportedly working on next-gen, water-resistant AirPods"},"content":{"type":"html","$t":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/apple\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apple\"\u003EApple\u003C\/a\u003E is reportedly working on a new, likely more expensive, set of AirPods with noise-cancellation, according to \u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2018-06-25\/apple-is-said-to-amplify-its-audio-device-strategy-in-2019\"\u003EBloomberg\u003C\/a\u003E.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe report cites people familiar with the matter, who said that Apple is exploring making the AirPods water resistant.

Every year your faithful friends at TechCrunch spend an entire week looking at bags. Why? Because bags — often ignored but full of our important electronics — are the outward representations of our techie styles, and we put far too little thought into where we keep our most prized possessions.\u003C\/em\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few months back \u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/01\/11\/peak-designs-everyday-backpack-was-my-surprise-hit-of-ces-2018\/\"\u003EI declared the\u003C\/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/www.peakdesign.com\/everyday-backpack\"\u003EPeak Design Everyday Backpack\u003C\/a\u003E the best thing at CES 2018. It was a silly comment since the bag was released a couple years back but it was new to me. I had purchased the bag from Best Buy a few days prior and was in love with the bag and had to tell the world. I’m happy to report that after carrying the bag around several more conferences and a family trip to Disney World, I’m comfortable declaring it the best \u003Ca class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/backpack\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"backpack\"\u003Ebackpack\u003C\/a\u003E I’ve ever used.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe company recently released a black version and sent me one to test. It looks mean. It’s the backpack Darth Vader would carry if he needed to tout around a full frame DSLR, a couple lenses and a MacBook Pro.\u003C\/p\u003E[gallery ids=\"1661479,1661478,1661477,1661475,1661476,1661480,1661482\"] \u003Cp\u003EThe bag’s main clasp is wonderful. It’s designed in such a way that the wearer can quickly open and securely close it. Just pull down and away to open the bag. To close it, pull down so the top is tight, place the clasp next to the \u003Ca class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/metal\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"metal\"\u003Emetal\u003C\/a\u003E rungs and let go. Magnets hold the clasp next to the bag and the tension on the top causes the clasp to find the next available rung. Try it and you’ll love it. I do.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeak Design equipped the bag with solid hardware. All the clasps are metal and the zippers are durable. I don’t think there’s plastic anywhere on the bag.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike I said several months ago, the bag is best described as smart and solid. It’s a confident design with just enough pockets and storage options. The bag features one, large pocket that makes up most of the bag. Foldable dividers allow the wearer to customize the bag as needed. And quickly, too. These dividers fold in several ways, allowing the bag to hold, say, a large telephoto lens or several smaller lens.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bag is packed full of surprises, too. Straps are hidden throughout allowing it to hold a surprising amount of items even a drone.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cdiv id=\"attachment_1661480\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\u003E\u003Cimg class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-1661480\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/peak-design_8770.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" \/\u003E\u003Cp class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003ESmall packing cubes make the Peak Design Everyday Backpack a storage cabinet. This is my bag while traveling overseas.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeak Design positions this bag as a camera bag, but it can be so much more with some little bags. I use \u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Travelon-Packing-Squares-Organizers-Toiletry\/dp\/B01M3YQR0E\/ref=sr_1_2_a_it?ie=UTF8\u0026amp;qid=1529326756\u0026amp;sr=8-2\u0026amp;keywords=small+packing+cubes+travelon\"\u003Ethese\u003C\/a\u003E and they fit perfectly in both the 20L and 30L bag. It lets me keep things organized and separated in a way that I’ve haven’t found possible in other bags. Peak Design should look at making a series of these bags. I would be all over them if they did.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bag I bought back before CES was the 20L. It’s the smallest option though far from small. My 15-inch MacBook Pro squeezes into the laptop compartment and the bag has yet to feel too small even when it’s holding a camera, a couple books and a travel pillow.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new black bag looks amazing but it seems to show scuffs and dirt more than my grey one. That’s a shame, too. I throw my bags around and expect a lot out of them. This black bag looks more dirty after one oversea trip than my grey one does after six months of use.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust like I said back at CES, I’m not going to run through all the details of this bag. A few more are worth calling out: The sternum strap is fantastic. It uses clips without moving parts so it should last a lifetime. The shoulder straps are attached to the bag with a rivet that allows the straps to swivel as needed — it’s a smart advancement in the design of a backpack. And inside the laptop sleeve is a small pocket that is absolutely perfect to hold a Traveler’s Notebook and a pen.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs backpacks go, the Peak Design Everyday Backpack costs more than most. The smaller 20L is $260 and the 30L is $290. To me, the higher price is justified and if there’s a backpack worth the extra cost, it’s this one. I highly recommend this bag.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Chr \/\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EBag design with Peak Design\u003C\/h2\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ciframe class='youtube-player' type='text\/html' width='640' height='390' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/fzfwJheVcEM?version=3\u0026amp;rel=1\u0026amp;fs=1\u0026amp;autohide=2\u0026amp;showsearch=0\u0026amp;showinfo=1\u0026amp;iv_load_policy=1\u0026amp;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'\u003E\u003C\/iframe\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EFolks, it’s Bag Week!

There is no fancy nylon mesh or gear organizers here, just a brown expanse of full grain leather.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/b1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" class=\"breakout alignright size-full wp-image-1660817\" \/\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wore this backpack for a few months before writing this and found it surprisingly comfortable and great for travel. Because it is so simple I forced myself to pare down my gear slightly and I was able to consolidate my cables and other accessories into separate pouches. I could fit a laptop, iPad Pro, and a paperback along side multiple notebooks and planners and I could even overstuff the thing on long flights. As long as I was able to buckle the front strap nothing fell out or was lost.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis bag assumes that you’re OK with thick, heavy leather and that you’re willing to forgo a lot of the bells and whistles you get with more modern styles. That said, it has a great classic look and it’s very usable. I suspect this bag would last decades longer than anything you could buy at Office Depot and it would look good doing it. At $275 it’s a bit steep but you’re paying for years – if not decades – of regular use and abuse.

You could give it a verbal or programmatic command or you could have it watch your brain for signs of distress and have it stop itself. That’s what researchers at MIT’s robotics research lab have done with a system that is wired to your brain and tells robots how to do their job.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe initial system is fairly simple. A scalp EEG and EMG system is connected to a Baxter work robot and lets a human wave or gesture when the robot is doing something that it shouldn’t be doing. For example, the robot could regularly do a task – drilling holes, for example – but when it approaches an unfamiliar scenario the human can gesture at the task that should be done.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“By looking at both muscle and brain signals, we can start to pick up on a person’s natural gestures along with their snap decisions about whether something is going wrong,” said PhD candidate Joseph DelPreto. “This helps make communicating with a robot more like communicating with another person.”\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause the system uses nuances like gestures and emotional reactions you can train robots to interact with humans with disabilities and even prevent accidents by catching concern or alarm before it is communicated verbally. This lets workers stop a robot before it damages something and even help the robot understand slight changes to its tasks before it begins.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn their tests the team trained Baxter to drill holes in an airplane fuselage. The task changed occasionally and a human standing nearby was able to gesture to the robot to change position before it drilled, essentially training it to do new tasks in the midst of its current task. Further, there was no actual programming involved on the human’s part, just a suggestion that the robot move the drill left or right on the fuselage. The most important thing? Humans don’t have to think in a special way or train themselves to interact with the machine.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“What’s great about this approach is that there’s no need to train users to think in a prescribed way,” said DelPreto. “The machine adapts to you, and not the other way around.”\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe team will present their findings at the Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) conference.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Ciframe class='youtube-player' type='text\/html' width='640' height='390' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/_Or8Lt3YtEA?version=3\u0026amp;rel=1\u0026amp;fs=1\u0026amp;autohide=2\u0026amp;showsearch=0\u0026amp;showinfo=1\u0026amp;iv_load_policy=1\u0026amp;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'\u003E\u003C\/iframe\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?a=epcijJQKAOs:JEVMoiQdwds:V_sGLiPBpWU\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?i=epcijJQKAOs:JEVMoiQdwds:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\" \/\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?a=epcijJQKAOs:JEVMoiQdwds:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?i=epcijJQKAOs:JEVMoiQdwds:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\" \/\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?a=epcijJQKAOs:JEVMoiQdwds:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" \/\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/3novices\"\u003EFor details check twitter.com\/3novices\u003C\/a\u003E"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/3novices.blogspot.com\/feeds\/7729986654016771725\/comments\/default","title":"Post Comments"},{"rel":"replies","type":"text/html","href":"http:\/\/3novices.blogspot.com\/2018\/06\/3novicesnew-system-connects-your-mind.html#comment-form","title":"0 Comments"},{"rel":"edit","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/feeds\/338394477269451686\/posts\/default\/7729986654016771725"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/feeds\/338394477269451686\/posts\/default\/7729986654016771725"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http:\/\/3novices.blogspot.com\/2018\/06\/3novicesnew-system-connects-your-mind.html","title":"3Novices:New system connects your mind to a machine to help stop mistakes"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"3novices"},"uri":{"$t":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/profile\/11914359123337263458"},"email":{"$t":"noreply@blogger.com"},"gd$image":{"rel":"http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail","width":"16","height":"16","src":"https:\/\/img1.blogblog.com\/img\/b16-rounded.gif"}}],"media$thumbnail":{"xmlns$media":"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/","url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/_Or8Lt3YtEA\/default.jpg","height":"72","width":"72"},"thr$total":{"$t":"0"},"gd$extendedProperty":[{"name":"commentSource","value":"1"},{"name":"commentModerationMode","value":"FILTERED_POSTMOD"}]},{"id":{"$t":"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-338394477269451686.post-7591020155701893614"},"published":{"$t":"2018-06-19T21:43:00.001+05:30"},"updated":{"$t":"2018-06-19T21:43:20.236+05:30"},"category":[{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"Gadgets"}],"title":{"type":"text","$t":"3Novices:PAX introduces Session Control to let novice users control their intake"},"content":{"type":"html","$t":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/www.paxvapor.com\/\"\u003EPAX Labs\u003C\/a\u003E, makers of the popular PAX 3 and PAX Era vaporizers, have today updated their app to offer a new feature called Session Control.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea here is based around the fact that people can sometimes overindulge when using a vaporizer for the first time, as the effects of cannabis oil can take a minute or two to kick in, leading people to continue puffing.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/4.jpg?w=583\" alt=\"\" width=\"583\" height=\"680\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1659166\" \/\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith Session Control, users can control their intake by selecting micro, small or medium puffs.

If you particularly like the style – F1 racing meets Kylo Ren – then you’re probably going to like this thing and since they’ve already surpassed their goal and hit $602,000 you can expect delivery of your perk.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, watches like this one require a specific style and taste. The LIV is reminiscent of Alpina and Tissot in its case style and decoration and it pays homage to racing and speed. Grabbing a Swiss made watch for under $1,000 is a treat and this is a good example of the species and well worth a look.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"feedflare\"\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?a=8k6sZ7mDLr0:EEsO4PD9mAQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?i=8k6sZ7mDLr0:EEsO4PD9mAQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\" \/\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?a=8k6sZ7mDLr0:EEsO4PD9mAQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?i=8k6sZ7mDLr0:EEsO4PD9mAQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\" \/\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?a=8k6sZ7mDLr0:EEsO4PD9mAQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~ff\/crunchgear?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" \/\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/3novices\"\u003EFor details check twitter.com\/3novices\u003C\/a\u003E"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/3novices.blogspot.com\/feeds\/3993937486907709769\/comments\/default","title":"Post Comments"},{"rel":"replies","type":"text/html","href":"http:\/\/3novices.blogspot.com\/2018\/06\/3novicesliv-is-kickstarting-beefy-and.html#comment-form","title":"0 Comments"},{"rel":"edit","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/feeds\/338394477269451686\/posts\/default\/3993937486907709769"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/feeds\/338394477269451686\/posts\/default\/3993937486907709769"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http:\/\/3novices.blogspot.com\/2018\/06\/3novicesliv-is-kickstarting-beefy-and.html","title":"3Novices:LIV is Kickstarting a beefy and bold chronograph for race lovers"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"3novices"},"uri":{"$t":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/profile\/11914359123337263458"},"email":{"$t":"noreply@blogger.com"},"gd$image":{"rel":"http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail","width":"16","height":"16","src":"https:\/\/img1.blogblog.com\/img\/b16-rounded.gif"}}],"thr$total":{"$t":"0"},"gd$extendedProperty":[{"name":"commentSource","value":"1"},{"name":"commentModerationMode","value":"FILTERED_POSTMOD"}]}]}});
