Yet the  latest version of the Explorer has taken a step away from truck  influences and reeled in its trail image. It shares much of its running  gear with Ford's large sedans, as well as the Ford Flex--and while that  might not be the right stuff for the Rubicon it's just right for  all-weather family transit.   \u003Cbr \/\u003ESimply put, for almost everything that a family would throw at the  Explorer, it does it better than before, and it does what the wide  majority of us want to do in a crossover.\u0026nbsp;It makes plenty of room for  lots of people, or lots of stuff, and it does it much more efficiently  than it ever did in the past. It holds on to those mud-running bona  fides too--even if they probably were only ever weekend ambitions for  most of their suburban owners.\u003Cbr \/\u003EIn style, the Explorer doesn't turn away too abruptly from the past.  Inside it does its best impression of a Taurus sedan in look and feel,  albeit a little more upright.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EThe 3.5-liter V-6 that's offered through most of the lineup is plenty  quick, while the front-wheel-drive Explorer with an EcoBoost four is  best kept for those who seldom if ever take advantage of this vehicles  spacious seating. The Explorer Sport is a different personality--very  quick, taut, and faster than any V-8 Explorer of the past; it's a  crossover extension of the Taurus SHO, essentially.   \u003Cbr \/\u003EThose carlike underpinnings mean that the 2014 Explorer can't quite  hit the trails with the likes of the Grand Cherokee. But on-the-road  handling is its forte, and it has quick, well-weighted steering plus  terrific ride control, thanks to its substantial curb weight and an  independent suspension. Highway miles truly are its friend.\u003Cbr \/\u003EThat doesn't preclude it from getting dirty now and then. A Terrain  Management system controls stability and other systems to limit  wheelspin while maintaining a 5,000-pound towing capacity. It's  definitely Explorer Lite compared to the distant past, but it's still  quite capable, in the wider view.\u003Cbr \/\u003EThe 2014 Ford Explorer has one of the most spacious interiors on the  market--especially if you judge it by passenger space. Up to seven  passengers can fit, and five adults will be fine in the front two rows.  Getting into the third row is a little tougher than it is for the Ford  Flex, as the Explorer sits taller. Every inch of this interior seems to  be designed with family use in mind, and a power tailgate and  power-folding seats are there to make it more convenient.\u003Cbr \/\u003EGoing by safety, the Explorer is one of the safest vehicles Ford builds,  with inflatable rear seat belts and rearview cameras and blind-spot  detectors. It also woos gearheads of another kind with MyFord Touch, the  convoluted but promising system that uses voice, button or touchscreen  control to govern infotainment and other vehicle functions. For 2014,  second-row heated seats and adaptive cruise control are newly available  on the Limited, and automatic headlamps have been made standard.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"revSecLink\"\u003EInterior \/ Exterior »\u003C\/span\u003E \u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EThe high-performance Explorer Sport makes the most of the car-like  side of its persona, with glossy black trim, 20-inch wheels, and mesh  grille inserts. It has more in common with a Taurus SHO than with a big  Expedition SUV, down to winged taillamps and a perforated grille, but  the Explorer still avoids looking like a sedan or a minivan.\u003Cbr \/\u003EInside, the current Explorer makes no attempt to give nod to the  past--and that's perfectly fine. Early Explorers had miserable,  plasticky interiors, which got better as it was groomed upmarket.  Nevermind the ungainly dashes in the Honda Pilot and Toyota Highlander.  It's up there with the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango in tailored  good looks, with maybe a half-degree more of the contemporary in its  win column, thanks to those exclamation points of metallic plastic on  the center stack.\u003Cbr \/\u003EAudi and BMW are in its crosshairs, Ford says, and the Explorer  delivers, in almost the same way the Flex and F-150 do. The cabin's a  knockout, smoothing off transitions between dissimilar plastics and  putting the curvy goodness into an interior that could have been  confused for a shoe-store stockroom, in the past.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"revSecLink\"\u003EPerformance »\u003C\/span\u003E                            \u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EThe standard engine on the Explorer is a 3.5-liter V-6, shared with  many Ford vehicles, from the Edge to the Flex. With 290 horsepower, it's  good for mid-eight-second 60-mph acceleration through a six-speed  automatic transmission. If it sounds pedestrian, it's good to recognize  that the six-cylinder's far more powerful on paper than the the V-8 in  the prior edition. Acceleration from a stop is strong, and most models  have a sport-shift mode for quicker throttle and shift responses, but  these Explorers don't get shift paddles to go with the automatic. The  transmission will hold lower gears when told, though, and that alone  makes it more responsive than almost any competitive crossover.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EIn the name of gas mileage, there's another option. A 2.0-liter  turbocharged four-cylinder with 240 horsepower and 270 pound-feet of  torque actually has more torque than the 255 lb-ft available with the  V-6, yet it's a little less certain if you plan to haul a heavy load of  passengers around on a regular basis. If you're the solo-commuter type,  it's a $1,000 option that will actually pay off for itself pretty  quickly, as it's rated at 20\/28 mpg. Overall, this engine makes some  grouching, flapping turbocharger noises that upset the Explorer's more  refined demeanor. Paddle-shifters would have made this combination more  drivable than it is, but they're not included; and keep in mind that  towing capacity slides to 2,000 pounds.\u003Cbr \/\u003ELast year Ford introduced a new 350-horsepower, twin-turbo-V-6  Explorer Sport model; it's offered only with all-wheel drive and gets a  raft of changes to go with its exceptional power (Ford says it's two  seconds quicker to 60 mph than the standard six-cylinder model).  Consider this a utility-vehicle version of the Taurus SHO; it gets  quicker steering, 20-inch wheels and tires, upgraded brakes, and a  stiffer front body structure. The Sport is far more fired up than the  old Explorer V-8; just don't expect it to chase a Grand Cherokee SRT8.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EIn its basic front-drive versions, the Explorer's electric power  steering and terrifically settled ride give it a nimble feel that's more  like that of the smaller Edge. The Explorer carves into corners with  zeal, and the steering unwinds with a feel that's closer to natural than  some hydraulic-steer vehicles. The electric steering also means the  Explorer can park itself--with the Active Park Assist options, which  uses cameras to maneuver the steering while the driver keeps tabs on  things with the brake pedal.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EThe 2014 Explorer can slosh through enough mud and ruts to get a  family of seven to any ski resort or any bed and breakfast that doesn't  require an overnight National Park Service permit. If you're arguing  over the lack of a low-gear ratio and frame rails and skid plates,  you're less likely to have been shopping an Explorer in the first place.  There's a multi-traction drive system that spins from Normal to Mud and  Ruts, Sand, and Snow modes, tailoring power and braking to suit the  conditions.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EIn esoteric instances, those electronics can't quite match a really  well-trained off-road driver, since they require a little slip in the  system to start working. For the remaining 95 percent of us, it's  welcome relief to worry less about descending a hill with brake and  engine modulation instead of simply flicking a switch.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003EPRICE\u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"revSecLink\"\u003E »\u003C\/span\u003E\u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"revSecLink\"\u003E»\u003C\/span\u003E\u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv id=\"yrmd-rating-price\"\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"price-txt invoice-txt\"\u003EBASE INVOICE\u003Cb\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"revSecLink\"\u003E»\u003C\/span\u003E\u003C\/b\u003E \u003Cspan style=\"color: #0b5394;\"\u003E\u003Cu\u003E$27,000\u003C\/u\u003E\u003C\/span\u003E        \u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"price-txt msrp-txt\"\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"price-txt msrp-txt\"\u003EBASE MSRP\u003Cb\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"revSecLink\"\u003E»\u003C\/span\u003E\u003C\/b\u003E \u003Cspan style=\"color: #0b5394;\"\u003E\u003Cu\u003E$29,600\u003C\/u\u003E\u003C\/span\u003E        \u003C\/div\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/carrate.blogspot.com\/feeds\/7478890841706053613\/comments\/default","title":"Post Comments"},{"rel":"replies","type":"text/html","href":"http:\/\/carrate.blogspot.com\/2013\/06\/ford-explorer-2014.html#comment-form","title":"0 Comments"},{"rel":"edit","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/feeds\/2444034004262531247\/posts\/default\/7478890841706053613"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/feeds\/2444034004262531247\/posts\/default\/7478890841706053613"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http:\/\/carrate.blogspot.com\/2013\/06\/ford-explorer-2014.html","title":"Ford Explorer 2014"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"Baljinder Singh"},"uri":{"$t":"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/105322952160411956301"},"email":{"$t":"noreply@blogger.com"},"gd$image":{"rel":"http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail","width":"32","height":"32","src":"\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/-pbprfYs9j2Q\/AAAAAAAAAAI\/AAAAAAAAAAs\/BspRCzqdJeo\/s512-c\/photo.jpg"}}],"media$thumbnail":{"xmlns$media":"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/","url":"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-JarbRm-Ko_8\/UcB5ZdLPbsI\/AAAAAAAAAKE\/dgslkNJzLZc\/s72-c\/2014-ford-explorer_100430658_400x240.jpg","height":"72","width":"72"},"thr$total":{"$t":"0"}},{"id":{"$t":"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2444034004262531247.post-6376051818824736727"},"published":{"$t":"2013-05-17T03:38:00.001-07:00"},"updated":{"$t":"2013-05-17T08:15:15.931-07:00"},"category":[{"scheme":"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#","term":"Ford"}],"title":{"type":"text","$t":"Ford-Mustang "},"content":{"type":"html","$t":"\u003Cdiv dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\" trbidi=\"on\"\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;
